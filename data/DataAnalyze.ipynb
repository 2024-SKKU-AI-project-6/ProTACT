This is a matter that has been disputed throughout the history of humans, and has been the a topic of great contraversy for many years.     Some say that one should have the right to censor a book that they find offensive. However, if one would take the time to think on the issue they @MONTH1 see that if everyone had the right to censor a book that they dispised, there would not be any books left in the world. In a population that contains so many different cultures and ethinicities, and reaches to almost every corner of the @LOCATION1, writing a book that everyone could enjoy and not find offensive could be an impossible task.

Even after this and many other articles have been written about the topic, it will still remain a topic of much debate. This is becuase everyone is different, and has their own opinions. Some say it is a great idea, and others say everyone is entitled to their own ways of living. However the issue will go on, because after all we are all different and have our own opinions.\"'},\n",

Just because it\\'s offensive to one person doesn\\'t mean that it would be to another person. Any movie you watch could be offensive to one person or two but, not everyone. So I would say no to taking the offensive things off the shelfs because, who is really going to be offened by and are they really offened by this matter or aspect.      Also, I believe that some people might lie about if they are offened by it just so that they will take it off the self. Maybe, there is a movie for example, that there is a lot of bad words, I could see them being able to take that off the self because, a lot of people don\\'t like those words to be used and thats understandable. If they are just taking it off the self tho for one little thing I don\\'t think that should be aloud.     I think that if that person is getting offened by what a book said or a movie said then don\\'t read it or don\\'t watch it. No body is forcing you to watch or read a book that you don\\'t want to. Reading and watching a certain movie is all up to you not what others say.      I believe that this really has to go down to what the persons beliefs are. Maybe they go to church every day which means that they probably aren\\'t going to be watching the movie \\' @CAPS1 @CAPS2.\\'  They are going to pick a movie more suitiable to their life style and what their use to. Maybe they had a friend that suggested that they should watch a movie and they did, they might have taking offensivness to that, but that was also there choice they didn\\'t have to watch it.      If this was the case to take a book, movie, music out because someone was offened then there would be nothing left. Are you saying that you would listen to everyone if they came in to get a book and then came back and said \\' this book offened me, I want you to take it off the self.\\' I\\'m sorry but, I\\'m having a hard time believing that your going to listen to every single person that comes in a says that. Also, @CAPS3 do you know it was offensive to them are you going to have them show you what was the problem with this book? My guess is no because you don\\'t want to deal with that many people about one or two maybe even five books.     I\\'m not saying that people don\\'t get offened by somethings that books and movies say but, your going to have a lot more then just one person come in and say that there are more then just one book or movie. so then there would be no books left. What if you have someone come in and they request that they have a certain movie and you say \\' @CAPS4, I\\'m sorry we had to take that movie off the self because, it offened someone.\\' I have a feeling that person is not going to be happy and you will have some explaining to do.     Also, what if a person comes in and asks for something and you tell them that you had to take it down and they say that it was a very nice movie are you going to listen to them also if you listen to one person don\\'t you think that its fair if you listen to the other person also that likes the movie. I am a person that believes theres two parts to every story. So, therefore, I think that you should listen to both sides or keep what you have if that person wants to take it off the self then do it but, if someone asks for that specific one then I would let them have it because that isn\\'t going to hurt the person that got offened by the book or movie is it.     Therefore, I think that they should keep the books, movies and music all on the seleves unless more then one person complains then it would be a different story.\"'},\n",

This has happened to myself many times, but the one time I remember most, was @CAPS2 I began making strange noises. I normally make sound @CAPS1 and such @CAPS2 I\\'m bored and want to start a conversation, but I had never laughed and made sounds like that before. That moment changed the way I laugh today. The date was @DATE1, it was my birthday, so I decided to have my party at @ORGANIZATION1. I invited my two best friends, @PERSON4 and @PERSON3, to tag along. We love to laugh and just have fun. So, inviting them was a no-brainer.  Immediately, we decided that our favorite water slide in the park was the grand and slightly over sized @ORGANIZATION2\\' @CAPS3. It was a large funnel with flashing red and @CAPS15 lights inside. We went on it over, and over, and over again. The adrenaline was pumping through our veins as the ride would end and we\\'d leaped from the inter tube and rush to the stairs where the waiting line was held. We talked, chatted, sang, yelled, and most likely annoyed every other person in line. Then, @CAPS2 we finally got to the top of the stairs, we became in awe of the lifeguard. But, not because he was gorgeous. He looked as if he was a wee little leprechaun! We stifled a small laugh and got on the ride. @PERSON4 asked him to turn the inter tube around so that she could go down the ride backwards. He then began to talk, and we couldn\\'t help but smirk. He began flirting with us by saying in his manly voice, \"\"@CAPS4 want me to ride down with @CAPS4 ladies?\"\" @CAPS2 he said that, @PERSON3 was the first to break. Then me. Then @PERSON4. We couldn\\'t hold it in anymore. He then awkwardly cackled and pushed the inter tube down the slide. We were laughing so hard that we weren\\'t even paying attention to the ride. Then it hit me.  \"\"That dude looks like @PERSON1 @PERSON1!!\"\" I screamed to @PERSON3. @CAPS2 the ride ended, we thought for a second. Then undoubtedly went again. Truth be told, he @CAPS8 look like @PERSON1. We began laughing again throughout the ride, up until I made a strangely abnormal sound. I made a noise that sounded as if a pig had just had it\\'s tail yanked. It was almost a shriek, but more of a squeal. @CAPS6 just happened? @CAPS8 I seriously just...just...@CAPS9?! Note: A best friend will always be there for @CAPS4, especially @CAPS2 @CAPS4 @CAPS8 something embarrassing. It\\'s their job to poke fun at one\\'s strangeness.   So of course, @PERSON4 was the first to say, \"\"@CAPS6 the heck was that?\"\"  @CAPS7 followed by @PERSON3\\'s expression of, \"\"@CAPS8 @CAPS4 just @CAPS9?\"\" That\\'s @CAPS2 we began to laugh and then I started making even more unusual noises. I started squealing, snorting, and hiccuping. We were still laughing at my crazy squel @CAPS2 we got off the inter tube.  Later after we had our fill of the @ORGANIZATION2\\' @CAPS3, @PERSON4 decided we should go in the wave pool. Of course, @PERSON3 and I agreed. The speaker system in the area started blaring the song \"\"@CAPS11\"\" by @PERSON2. @PERSON3 is my go-to-gal @CAPS2 it comes to breaking out in song. She began singing, then we all joined in. But @CAPS2 it got to the chorus, \"\"I throw my hands up in the air sometimes...\"\" we all said, \"\"I throw my banana in the air sometimes...\"\"  \"\"@CAPS12 my @CAPS13, we should totally make a song of our own.\"\" @PERSON4 said.  We began thinking of different lyrics we could say in our song. At first, we knew exactly @CAPS6 to say to fill in the chorus, then we decided that the song needed more lyrics. That was harder to think up. But, then we decided that we should make the song about food and the way we eat it. We had so much fun. Eventually, we came up with the entire song and people were staring at us as we screamed it to the world. Then, the terible noise arrived again. @PERSON4 began to laugh, then @PERSON3 and I joined in harmony, then a rude interruption by my @CAPS9. @PERSON4 and @PERSON3 continued to laugh at my sound @CAPS1. I joined in with them, laughing at myself.  That night we went to bed, humming the tune of our new song, \"\"@CAPS14 @CAPS15\"\" out loud. Now, whenever we hang out, we begin to sing our song, and sometimes, even dance! People still look at us strange, but then we just start laughing, and I start making sound @CAPS1.\"'},\n",

As a new form of transportation, dirigbles were not safe. This was proven true when the German dirigble, \"\"Hindenburg\"\", exploded in 1937. In addition, a more significant obstacle that was not adressed when the plan was created was the problem with its location. In the crowded streets of New York City, suspending flamable dirigibles above population is unsafe. This location is also an obstacle because of the equipment needed to land the dirigible: lead weights. The use of lead weights to way down the dirigibles is unimaginable with the possible dangerous situations it could create. The creators of this idea solely designed this system on top of the Empire State building to incorporate a futuristic form of transportation to make the building more unique.

After seeing what happened to the German dirigible \"\"Hindenburg\"\" in Lakehurst, Architects soon realized that having dirigibles filled with highly-flamable hydrogen over the densely populated New York City wasn\\'t a good idea. Nature itself would not allow the mooring mass to be built.There was such violent air currents at the one thousand and fifty foot tall @ORGANIZATION1 altitude that made Architects aware that this idea couldn\\'t be upheld. The dirigible would swivel around because it couldn\\'t be weighed down like in open landing fields.

Censoring and removal of these book are pointless; for the simple reason that at least three of the four are a current issue. @CAPS1 is strickly important for our generations to be aware of the heartships, problems, and lessons in which these topics araised. Without imforming our generations of these issues @CAPS1 could result in a repeat of history, which we as a country are trying to prevent!          My opinion on movies however are a little different. I believe some movies are okay; but they must not contain obvious and purpose acts of discrimnation and or offesive material. Most movies nowadays if they are offesive in a relating way to the movie then they are rated at least @CAPS5 @NUM1 or rated @CAPS5 @NUM2 this allows certain age groups able to watch material that @MONTH1 be offesive or perhaps discrimating. They @MONTH1 also need adult combinations to preview the movie.           So in my closing i would like for you to consider my opinion as a wise outlook on offensive/ discrimating issues. I just fully believe open @ORGANIZATION1 content is allowed at certain ages, depending on the content. Plently observations must be made by parents/ guradians if needed. I appreatiate your time and understanding of my letter! Thanks!                                              Sincerly,                                                                                     @PERSON1- @ORGANIZATION1\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\" Laughter is the cure to a sickness and the medicine to somebodies pain. Laughter can mend a friendship to make two strangers become the best of friends. A person can ask anybody on the street of how much laughter is important in life and they would say that laughter is very important. It\\'s like love, everyone needs a little of it in their life and like laughter, it helps a person grow and become an adult. A person can use laughter to help them with anything like getting a job, or trying to get the girl, or just having a good time and making new friends. It\\'s one of the main elements of life that make a person how they are and what they do. In the @DATE1 I was introduced to a girl named @DATE3, by my cousin @PERSON1. She started talking to me and I was shy because she was a girl and I wasn\\'t used to talking to girls. I cracked a joke and that made her and I laugh together and that was the first icebreaker to making a new friend. The days went by and we were text messaging each other each day over the phone, making jokes about how our day was and making jokes about each other. Eventually we started talking to each other over the phone. Teens these days usually don\\'t use the phone to call people and that makes emotions hard to understand because talking over text hides emotions from one another. @DATE3 called me and we would talk to each other until late in the @TIME1, to where we would both fall asleep and leave the phone on, and again we would always be making jokes about everything. Making each other laugh was one of our only connections with each other since she went to a different school. Making her happy was what I needed to do, and one of the ways to make her happy was to make her laugh or just be a charming young gentlemen because I was raised that way.  @DATE2 formal was coming near and I was in need of a date. @DATE3 was my best option for a date since I was getting close to her and I was starting to get attached to her. When I had the chance I asked her to be my date for the @DATE2 formal which would be one of the most special nights of my freshmen year. The day of the formal came and we danced the @TIME1 away and of course I had to make a few jokes about other things which made everyone laugh and have a good time. Near the end of the dance I asked her to be my girlfriend and she accepted. She said I was funny, and nice, and cute which was good. We had a fun time because good humor and fun kept the @TIME1 alive. The next @DATE2 formal, the same thing happened with a different girl except that laughter was an important key and that made the @TIME1 so much fun. That @TIME1 was one of the best nights of my life that I had ever had, because we were laughing and having the best @TIME1 ever. Laughter is an important key in my life. I would have never gotten the girl or have had the best @TIME1 of my life if laughter was never involved. Laughter makes everything better and I use it in my everyday life because everybody needs to have a good laugh if they are in a bad mood. Without laughter my life would be dull and have no color that would make me who I am today. It\\'s one of the many keys of life that everyone needs to be happy, and without it you would be less happy then you are right now. A small child could live his whole childhood without laughter or any other important element in his life and he could end up being a mean and cruel person who does not understand good values and humor. Everybody needs personality and color in their life and with out it everything id grey. Life is like a coloring book and without someone or something to color them in with, it\\'s just useless.\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\"To whom it @MONTH1 concern;      As a student, I find myself reading frequently: at home, at school, in the library, in the car, basically any place I can get my hands on a novel. However, the novels that I have read are not always novels I have chosen for my personal gain. I must admit, I am not an avid reader on my own. I am the kind of student that enjoys reading a book that interests me. Many of the books I choose are relatable to reality, which often involves content that @MONTH1 be considered explicit. I believe books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be taken off shelves.      As @CAPS1 citizens, we have the right to free speech. This allows us the freedom to speak our mind and express our thoughts without restricting our personalities.This law allows authors and producers the right to base their work on what they want. Media that @MONTH1 be considered explicit is appealing to a variety of people, and to some it is considered disturbing. With the freedom we have as @CAPS2, we have the choice to see said movies, or read said books, but we also have the choice to avoid those situations. When producers produce movies containing sexual content, language, or violence, they aren\\'t producing the movie, expecting every citizen to see it. They know some citizens are against that content. There is no law forcing us to see movies that we do not desire to see. We have the ability to choose what we want and do not want.      Explicit material is available everywhere you look. Walking in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, we see books, music, and magazines lining the walls, most containing explicit material. Though many novels contain explicit material, there are still numerous amounts that do not. People complain about explicit content in novels when in actuality, there are many novels without explicit content. We are trained as humans to look for the bad in situations. We lead pessimistic lifestyles. Citizens need to learn to realize not everything is terrible. Look for the good in situations. There is an abundance of media that contains no explicit content or sexual material and we are given warnings as to what contains and does not contain this material. These warnings are required! Labels such as @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 are set to prove that the following is open for general audiences with and without parental supervision. Parents have the authority to monitor what their child involves himself or herself in. They can set rules for their children, saying they @MONTH1 only see @CAPS3 rated movies, or they have to have parental consent to read a magazine or novel. Parents are guardians for a reason; they need to monitor their child and care for him or her. If they do not like the music, novels, movies, etc. that their child watches, change it! They have the authority and right to do so. Instead of taking explicit material off the market to everyone, limit what you, personally, want to be off limits to your family on your own, and talk to them about it!     Katherine Paterson is completely correct when she says, \\'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf. . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.\\' If we were given the right to remove and books, movies, magazines, etc. that we do not believe should be on the market, it is likely that we would have no media anymore. With the billions of citizens we have in @LOCATION1 alone, each individual is bound to find some flaw in a certain book. With each flaw found, we would want to eliminate that book, movie, or magazine from society, thus leaving us with no variety of material to choose from. People who feel strongly about eliminating explicit material would act quickly upon this law, rather than people who are against it. This would create a corrupt society, with a lot of fighting. We, as humans, enjoy the freedoms we are given and the choices we are allowed to make. Taking the freedom of what we read or watch away from us would take away or personality and sense of expression. Books, movies, and magazines are meant to be read based on opinion, and it should remain that way.     Books, movies, and magazines should be allowed to stay on the market even when they include explicit material. The choice to read or watch this material is up to the person, and should have no influence on other humans opinions.\"'},\n",

Have you ever gone to a library and the magazine you were looking for was behind everything else on the top shelf? Well if you have, you have experienced censorship. Censorship is where things are sheltered from the the light of day. A specific place of censorship is with books and magazines at libraries.     Most people today are worried about offensive things on and in books or magazines. A big question I ask is why? Well I can tell you why. Most people of today are too afraid of what other people think. Everything and everyone has to be perfect. I strongly disagree with this because if someone writes a book, they should not be afraid to put something in it because of what other people have to think about it. If they do not like it, then do not read it.     I do not think that things should be sheltered from libraries because sometimes it can get a point across to some people. If there is a article up on a shelf and it has an appealing image on it, you are going to stop and read it . If it has a good message to send to you will think about it. Then once you have thought about it, you will make your own opinion on what that article said. If you have a positive opinion you might go pick that magazine up and read it. If you have a negative opinion on what it said then you will not even look at the next time you go by there.     If you think that something is too bad for eyes of other people then so be it. That is your opinion and you have all of the right to it. I will not dislike you for your opinion and I will not look at you any differently. The only thing I hope is that I got my point across to you.\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\"The @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 great grandmother once told me that laughing adds and extra five years onto your life, she\\'s currently @NUM1 years old. Laughing can bring a new element to relationships; they embark on a journey, whether it be between two friends, family members, or something more. More or less, laughter is an essential piece. Sometimes you feel closer to people because it breaks down that barrier between what defines acquaintance and friends, but that\\'s actually how I met one of @CAPS3 good friends.  The incoming @CAPS11 were participating a traditional ritual (name game) that the high school puts the incoming @CAPS11 through at orientation. They were placing us in long lines that faced each other. For this particular game you had to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner along with one interesting fact about yourself. Unsurprisingly, everyone found this task ridiculous and embarrassing, but we were able to laugh if off. A whole new feeling overcame the room. That overwhelming and uneasy feeling simply floated away and all because of laughter. It broke that barrier and allowed us to open up. I guess it really is true that \"\"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.\"\" @CAPS4 back some of @CAPS3 best friendships were brought up through laughter. When I joined the cross country team for instance, the whole team unlike most other sports teams was like one big family. We share socks, @CAPS5-@CAPS6, tee shirts, shorts, water, sometimes even our watches, but we\\'ve also shared a great amount of laughs. Even while we run we talk to our friends and joke around, but trust that laughing while running is not easy! I think @CAPS3 best memory of it all was when we had our \"\"@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9\"\". The entire team of eighteen @CAPS7 or so met up at @LOCATION1\\'s house about a week before districts. The @CAPS10 had to bring snack foods, @CAPS11 had to bring drinks, and @CAPS12 brought the candy, and the @CAPS13 all chipped in for the \"\"main ingredient\"\". That first bit of the @CAPS8 was alright, but all were in anticipation for that hour hand to strike twelve. When it did, we were @CAPS9. The \"\"main ingredient\"\" to that @CAPS8 was the toilet paper. We were going @CAPS9 on a tee-pee raid!  The first event was forking the coaches lawn; but not with just any old forks, these forks were special. For some reason the coach had this odd obsession with @CAPS14, so in spite of that a few of the @CAPS7 photo shopped his head onto the bodies of lawn @CAPS14. I was in pure amazement and not laughing was impossible. I don\\'t think I ever could have @CAPS16 up with something so clever.  After that little stop we were onto the main event, the tee-peeing. We tried to tee-pee one of the brother\\'s from the team, but there dad had already been waiting up. The other pair of brother\\'s were next. All the cars slowly approached the culdesac, we lowered the the radios and shut off all the headlights. Just to be safe, everybody made sure to park at least four houses away and left all the doors open for a quick escape. Almost synchronized, everybody threw there first roll towards the the big tree on the side of the house. We kept missing and the rolls were would fall back down and unravel into the street, one could have called us the worst tee-peers ever. Then all of a sudden three figures came bolting @CAPS9 on skateboards with their own rolls of toilet paper yelling, \"\"@CAPS15! Get back here you forgot something!\"\". We were being ambushed! Sprinting back, we just barely made it to the cars. Still, something just didn\\'t feel right. There was just this eerie feeling, like being in a horror movie. Then; suddenly, as we began to drive away, something big hit the car. In panic, @ORGANIZATION1 stopped the car and had to get @CAPS9 to make sure nobody had been hit. \"\"@CAPS16 get your toilet paper!\"\", a deep voice yelled. All the @CAPS7 started screaming in terror. What was going to happen now? What was even going on? Were we going to be killed? No,and fortunately we weren\\'t killed that @CAPS8! In relief we discovered that it was only @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @LOCATION2, but I might as well have had a heart attack. Instantaneously, the whole group burst @CAPS9 in laughter and I had been laughing so hard that I began to cry. I\\'ve ever laughed so much or so hard in @CAPS3 life and I\\'ll ever forget it.  Laughter @MONTH1 not have brought just two people together, but nearly twenty. When districts came and passed, I know everyone was sad to see the season @CAPS16 to a close. It was the @CAPS13 last season and nobody wanted to see them leave; but all the great times we had will never be lost, and bonds are @CAPS2. \"'},\n",

Sometimes we shouldn\\'t laugh at other people because @CAPS3 could hurt them even more then we imagine, and @CAPS3 could even affect their life @CAPS2 they grow older. When I was younger I faced a situation which affected me @CAPS2 I grew up. I have always enjoyed singing ever since I could remember, but up to one point I couldn\\'t bare to sing in front of a crowd or even my family.  I was about four years old. @CAPS3 was a dark @DATE1 @TIME1, my family decided that we were going to go out to have some fun at a place called @ORGANIZATION1. This @ORGANIZATION1 was where family and friends could get together to have a great time, there would be a band playing, bright round colorful tables to sit at, drinks, and @CAPS3 had a game room for the children to play at. My cousin\\'s and their band were going to playing that @TIME1. My family and I got all dressed up, I wore a beautiful white dress that my mother had chose for me to wear. I looked like a star in my own eyes and I was satisfied. When we arrived my family and I sat at a bright, lime green, glow in the dark, round table and watched the performance.  I danced with my parents for a long time and then I would play games with my brother and friends. My cousin who is the lead singer of the band was calling out in the microphone if anyone would like to sing a @CAPS1 to the crowd. I ran to my parents and told them that this was my chance to shine and that I wanted to do @CAPS3. They smiled at me and said \"\"yes sweetheart, of course you can do @CAPS3!\"\" @CAPS2 I ran up to where my cousin was standing, I pushed through the bundle of children so that I could be in the front. I looked up smiled, and raised my hand at my cousin shouting for her to chose me. My cousin smiled back and picked me up and placed me on the speaker! I was so delighted, I couldn\\'t even breath. @CAPS3 was my biggest dream to stand up here with a microphone in my hand. @CAPS2 I stood on the big speaker box, I looked at the crowd of people and took a deep breath and I began to sing. I was singing my most favorite @CAPS1 that I knew by memory. The crowd smiled and clapped, but @CAPS2 soon @CAPS2 I sang the chorus of the @CAPS1 everyone started to laugh. I didn\\'t know why they were laughing. Was @CAPS3 because I accidentally forgot to take my gum out of my mouth? Because I did happen to forget. Or was @CAPS3 because I sounded really bad? I was so scared, the gum that I was chewing in my mouth started to harden and my voice grew faint. I began to panic, my eyes started to become watery. I noticed tears coming down all over my face. I couldn\\'t even bare being up in front of all these people if they were going to laugh at me. So I jumped off the speaker, ran to my mother, and began to cry in her lap. I cried for a long hour, my family tried telling me that everything was fine and that I did a magnificent job, but @CAPS3 wasn\\'t enough for me to believe @CAPS3. Over the years I always detested singing in front of people. @CAPS3 scared me just having the thought of maybe someone would burst out laughing because I was either bad, or off key. After that I always began to tell myself that I had a horrible voice and I knew @CAPS3 was the reason why the crowd at the @ORGANIZATION1 laughed at me. Every time my parents would ask me to sing a @CAPS1 I would tell them \"\"no thank you, I don\\'t like to sing anymore.\"\" @CAPS3 wasn\\'t true at all, I lied about @CAPS3 to my own parents, but I still had that horrible feeling in my heart and soul. Now that I am older I understand why I was so terrified, and the reason why the people laughed wasn\\'t at all what I thought @CAPS3 was. My parents told me that @CAPS3 was because the people thought that I was adorable, and since I was young I couldn\\'t really pronounce some words right. I giggled at @CAPS3, and now I just keep telling myself that I can sing because nothing else is going to bring me down, and I am trying to stay positive about @CAPS3. @CAPS3\\'s still very hard for me to sing a solo, but after a certain period of time I will have the strength and courage to sing to anyone. \"'},\n",

I believe that laughter is useful in getting to know people you\\'ve just met and growing closer to people you care about. In my opinion @CAPS2 brings people closer and can change a bad situation upside down. Getting enough bravery to gain new friends, ask this girl out and eventually develop a good relationship with her, is where laughter played an important role. @CAPS2 was the @DATE1 I was fifteen and a sophomore at @ORGANIZATION1 school. @CAPS2 was my first year there. I have been to many schools, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 wood, etc. and like any new school I was having a hard time connecting on a social level with my peers. Everyday I woke up, got ready, went to school, got home did homework (maybe), and went to bed . @CAPS2 was a boring cycle that I seemed to be trapped in. The image of being cool and trying to fit in did not seem to work so much. Because one thing I realized was that trying to be cool and something you\\'re not only gets you so far. The one thing that kids, people in general, like is when you\\'re real and being yourself . I found that out later on, but I actually didn\\'t realize that\\'s what people liked the most. I said to myself one time that I didn\\'t like trying to act like someone or something because the truth was I actually thought that I was a cool person deep down. So I changed my ways I stopped trying to act cool, and acted like myself. And @CAPS2 turned out that I actually was cool and that girls actually found me attractive, and not only attractive but a funny person that was likable. My main attribute, well besides my looks was my ability to make people laugh or at least smile. @CAPS2 gained me many friends that I didn\\'t have in the beginning. @CAPS2 even gained me one of the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Her name was @LOCATION2, in my eyes there was no girl that could compare to her in any way. She had the body of a coca cola bottle, caramel skin, and the face of a goddess ( and I\\'m not exaggerating). Like any beautiful girl she had many followers and admirers who were similar to me. So what chance did I have? What did I, @PERSON1 have to offer her? Laughter. My greatest attribute that had come to my rescue many of times. Even though @CAPS2 didn\\'t last as long as I would have liked @CAPS2( forever) @CAPS2 was great being with her for as long as I did, the things we got to do and the many experiences we had together, are priceless. And @CAPS2 was all because of my ability to make her laugh and to put a smile on her face. I believe that without laughter this world would not be the place that @CAPS2 is today. Sure, there is still crime and many horrors and atrocity\\'s committed today, but imagine how horrid @CAPS2 would be without laughter. Joy, which I believe is the core of what laughter brings, allows us to forgive and forget. @CAPS2 allows us to turn our heads and overlook things. Without us being able to laugh how could we expect to survive the future\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\"There are many books, movies, and magazines on shelves that can offence people in many ways. These can be books of war, slavery, and even religion that could aggrevate people and make them feel the need for them to remove those books from the libraries without hesitation.      There are indeed many books out there that could offence people and could be discriminating, but should those books really be taken out? I believe that books were made for a purpose. Each book and even magazine has a fact of information regarding what is either happening in the world or what could happen. Even for the books that are unrealistic they are also made for a reason and should be allowed to have their place in the library.      The library has over thousands of books and movies to choose from. If there even was one book that someone found discriminating or offensive they could always just pass by it and choose one that suits what they want. I feel that it is the person\\'s choice of what they want to read or watch not the books or movies fault.     The books and movies are also split into genres into which each movie and book belongs in. So if you don\\'t specifically want to see something than you can just skip the section the movies or books are in that you find discriminating and go to the ones that you feel okay with.      There are also many books and movies out there that might seem discriminating but they could actually teach you about life and what could happend and how to solve these problems. One example is when I was child growing up I was reading about this girl getting into a car accident and loosing everything just because she was drunk while she was driving. My mother didn\\'t want me reading the book, but it actually helped me alot because it taught me the valuable lesson of never drinking and driving, because of reading that book at such a young age and implanting the story in my head I know that I will never in my life do what that girl did to herself.      This shows that even if a book might seem discriminating and wrong it can still teach people life lessons and danger that they probably wouldn\\'t know about unless they read that book or watched that movie.      I feel that even if we removed the offensive magazines, books, and movies that don\\'t have any potential what so ever, people would still find a way to get what they were looking for, even if it is from the library or not. There are many people that are wrong in this world and banning certain books from the library probably wouldn\\'t stop them from doing what they want to do.      Music is another thing that shouldn\\'t be that troubled about. Some people listen to certain types of music to calm their nerves down. One example is the @CAPS1 rapper @ORGANIZATION1. His songs consist of severe sadness and frequent cussing, but in his songs are messages that can relate to other people and listening to that certain song might stop them from doing illegal things or even commiting suicide. The songs can symbolize their lives and make them know that they are not the only ones living that way and that they aren\\'t always alone in what they do.      I feel that each book, movie, and magazine has at least one thing that a person can find offensive. If we start removing each one that someone finds offencive than there probably wouldn\\'t be a single book left on the library shelves.      The books we read, the magazines we glance at, and the movies we watch will probably have something offensive in them but I do not think that they should be censored or removed becasue there is always a chance that those books, movies, or magazines could help you out later in life\"'},\n",

Everybody is entitled to their own views and opinions, but they can\\'t make others see things their way. If someone was at a library, and thought the \\'@CAPS1 @CAPS2\\' series were offensive, they might be the only ones to think that.

They\\'re the only one with the problem.     Everyone has the right to view or listen to what they want, as long as it\\'s legal. If someone finds a type of music that they find offensive, they can\\'t tell the store to remove it. One person can\\'t change everything to fit their needs. They would be making plenty of people unhappy if that type of music was removed. To make everyone happy, the person could just not listen it. There\\'s a huge selection of music a person could listen to, without being uncomfortable.     One person cannot make the desicions for everyone. The president doesn\\'t even make the desicions by himself; he has the government helping him. If one person felt as if a magazine was inappropriate, they don\\'t have the right to change it.

I believe that everyone\\'s entitled to their own opinions and views, but they shouldn\\'t make everyone see it their way. Books, music, movies, and magazines are few of the things that people try to control because they\\'re uncomfortable with the subject inside the material.

You know when your in a new class and you don\\'t know anybody in there so its kinda awkward because you feel like your a loner. I try to make the best of a situation and try to make new friends but I\\'m not always the best at it, so when i get a chance i make them laugh. First we take baby steps and the more we laugh together it seems like the closer we are to each other. By the end of the semester you don\\'t really like the class but you don\\'t want it to be over because you made such a good friend. The next semester you find out you have a class with that person but they don\\'t like the class so they move out. Then you realize you guys kinda grow apart because you never see each other and if you never talk then it gets kinda awkward. The way we started off our friendship was really by accident but i didn\\'t know many people in the class and the people that i did know weren\\'t really my friends. We sat by each other, and after so long of awkward silence between us two she made a joke and i started to laugh. The next thing we know is within a week and would talk to each other and soon enough we hung out some. About half way through the semester we would get in trouble in class for talking to much and we started to realize we were starting to be best friends. The semester went on and we were hanging out more and more and she was the only one i would hang out with sometimes. By the time the semester was almost over we didn\\'t know what our classes were so we thought we would be split up. The day we got our schedules we talked to each other and seen what our classes were. We seen we had one class together and we were excited. The first day of the second semester we went into the art class that we had together and we were laughing the whole time. At the end of the period she told me she didn\\'t want to be in that class because shes not an artsy type of person. I went to my sixth period and was wondering if she was actually going to switch out like she said or not. At the end of sixth period I seen her and she told me that she got switched out and went to a class that she wanted. I know people in that class still but its not the same because I knew we were going to lose our friendship because we would never see each other. Its a couple weeks into the last semester and we hardly ever talk sometimes it gets awkward just to be around her because its not like how it used to be. Laughter is how me and her became friends and classes is what tore us apart.\"'},\n",

Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes \"\"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\"\" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso\\'s parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso\\'s home, as he writes, \"\"the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home.\"\" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word \"\"warm\"\" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes \"\"It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love\"\" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: \"\"Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\"\" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir.\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\"Laughter, @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 on an @CAPS3 @DATE1 @CAPS4  One of my favorite @DATE1 traditions is the visit to the house of our @CAPS2, the @CAPS5. They live on eighty forested and meadowed acres outside of a quaint, old town. Their small green house overlooks brown fields and a blue pond, with tall trees forming a backdrop.  We arrive midmorning. We either find our @CAPS2 in the house or encounter them tromping out of the woods to meet us, shovels, chainsaws and other trailbuilding implements in their hands. After the customary hello, how have you been, we often wander around the yard, exclaiming at the new fruit trees or hearing stories about the latest tenants of the birdhouses.  During the hottest part of the @CAPS4, we head for the shade of the lush @ORGANIZATION1 woods. A short walk will bring us to a trail. I love walking among the sun-streaked ferns and fallen logs, treading carefully the rickety bridges over burbling streams, bouncing confidently on the sturdy new bridges, and trying to avoid the dogs as they galumph in and out of the water. @PERSON2 knows all about the flora and fauna of the region, so we get a constant stream of knowledge as we hike. He also, of course, has to tell us about the trees he\\'s planted -- a redwood here (look how well it\\'s doing! A foot since last fall!) and a douglas fir over there (not as well. That big redwood is shading it too much). One of the best parts of the hike is when we see the dead-end section of trail that my family helped construct three years ago. We always walk to the end of it and discuss where it could go from there -- over the stream or beside it, or up the hill and if so, where would the switchbacks be? could you really bike up a trail like that?  After our walk, we arrive back at the house, sweaty and talkative. Then it\\'s time to put on swimsuits and jump in the pond! They recently built a dock that we can jump off of -- a great improvement over wading in from the edge. We swim for the majority of the @TIME1, racing from one end of the pond to the other, splashing on innertubes, having pondweed-throwing battles. Finally we get tired and sit by the side of the pond, drying off in the warm sun.  By @TIME1, dinner is ready. Laura usually makes salmon, accompanied by a plethora of delicious side dishes. We drag chairs out to the hill above the pond and enjoy a leisurely supper. From the hill, we can see turtles and birds on the pond, bugs over the fields, and more birds swooping through the air feasting on the aforementioned bugs. After the meal, we haul chairs and dishes back to the house and sit on the porch into the @TIME2.  @PERSON2\\'s favorite part of the @CAPS4 is at dusk, when the sun is at just the right angle to show all the bugs swirling through the air. At one point, all the bugs gather together and create a tornado, twisting upwards into the darkening sky, and then -- they\\'re gone, until the next @CAPS4. It\\'s an incredible spectacle; thousands of tiny insects disappering at one swoop.  The best thing about these days is the friendship and comradery we have with this wonderful family. The parents knew each other long before us kids were born, so we have a lot to talk about; @PERSON2 is very interested in science topics, and he always finds a way to bring up the latest article he read. And, as with all great @CAPS2, we laugh constantly. I consistently get hiccups at least three times just when we\\'re lounging on the porch after our busy @CAPS4. Even on the most serious topics, my dad or the @PERSON1 boys can find a joke to make, usually \"\"politically incorrect\"\" but always very funny.  Now don\\'t even get me started on the @DATE1 camping trips, winter ski trips or autumn cider pressing we do with the @CAPS5. \"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, or music should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I do believe so. The reason why is because there can be a lot of books, movies, or magazines in certain places like the library or stores that can involve offensive stuff, such as violence or other bad things. A lot of things can influence to the reader if they read a book that is offensive or if a kid see\\'s a movie that involves violence.     One reason I think that books should be removed from the shelves is if they are found offensive  because what if the reader is reading the book and they find a word that offends them? Or what if they read a book and it talks about bad stuff? Or maybe a kid can read a book and can learn bad stuff. A lot of things can just occurr while reading a book. And many people sometimes take it real offensive if the book talks about there religion, race, or anything that involves to there personal life. That\\'s why I think books should be removed off the shelf, so people will not get offended.     Another reason will have to be that if a kid or someone under age rents a movie or there parents rent the movie. Then the kid would probably want to see the movie and they would not know what the movie is about. The kid might see something that is bad or might see a lot of violence. Sometimes parents don\\'t really realize what there kid\\'s are watching. So it\\'s important for them to learn and watch for there kids. In movie\\'s anyone can  see a lot of bad thing that can effect anyone or can offend anyone. So I think that they should not have certain  movies on the  shelves that can harm or offend certain family or parents, espicially there kids.     Magazines can also be found offensive to a lot of people. Whenever you go to the store you always see magazines on the shelves or somewhere else. It\\'s either talking about singers, people divorcing, violence that ocurr around the world, arrests, or it could even have bad images that anyone could see. Which would be something bad, especially if a little kid picks up a magazine that has soemthing bad inside. That\\'s why they shouldnt have magazines that have bad stuff in public. Or adults shouldn\\'t buy certain type of magazines because they never know what there child can expect to see.          So there is a lot of reasons why I think that people should remove certain book, movies, magazines, or anything that involves offensive stuff. All around the world you will see stuff that can offend you or anyone else just by seeing something on a movie, by listening to a song, or even my reading a book. It\\'s just not a good idea of having stuff out there like that in certain places, like the library, stores, or anywhere else. Especially if there is people that take it really offensive when they see a title of a book that is bad or when they hear a song that has a lot of bad words. It\\'s just wrong having stuff like that that can offend a lot of people. What if I read a book and it talks about my race or religion, would I take it offensive? People should ask themself that, before they read a book or see a movie. So they will decide whether or not they should have books, magazines, or music removed from the shelves.\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\" When I was in third grade my parents decided that we should move to where my @CAPS1 was born and raised and where my @CAPS2 lived. I, being a determined third grader, was angry and told them that I would not move and even sat on the floor and told them that I was not going. Needless to say I did not get very far, but I was still not happy about being moved from my friends and my @CAPS3\\'s side of the family that I had been around since I was little. My friends were all I had known through my years in elementary school and I was no where near ready to say goodbye to them. It was very hard saying goodbye to them even though we came back and visited later on. We moved three hours away from my hometown. It was a pretty big move, especially for a ten year old who had never really been anywhere else.  Being a new student is never easy. Especially with a shy, quiet personality like mine is and the first day was a scary one. I remember it very vividly. I walked in with my @CAPS4 and my new teacher happened to be in the office at the time, so she took me down to the class and showed me around the school. I was still frightened and was upset that my parents were making me go through this huge change. When class started the teacher made me stand up in front of the class and tell them about myself. I have never been much of a public speaker and it is hard for me to believe that I actually did stand there and talk about myself. I can not even do that very well today, and I am way less shy then I was back then. It was very terrifying to say the least even more so when I was done speaking and the class sat in dead silence. Then I slowly walked to my seat and being the shy person I am, did not talk for the rest of the time until lunch.  At lunch a little girl with freckles and glasses, like myself, came and sat with me. Once she broke down my shy exterior we were laughing, playing and having a real good time. And for the first time that day I thought to myself that moving might turn out to be okay. Me and her became really good friends along with the other girls she hung out with. We sat next to each other in class, talked on the phone, had sleepovers and spent recess together everyday. She was the first best friend I had made when I moved and I was glad it was her and not someone else. Today I am very thankful to her for taking the time to get to know me when I at first was shy and not saying much, because I know how it feels to approach someone you do not know.  The laughter that we shared that first day at lunch and her willingness to break down my walls of shyness really brought us close together. Without her that first day I am unsure how the rest of that day or week would have gone. Without people like her who are willing to make a new friend it would have been a lonely first couple of days for me. Laughter is an important part of a relationship because it brings people closer together and shows that even if you do not know someone very well you still can have a good time. The rest of that day is a better memory because we shared laughter and became friends. It made moving to a new school less scary and helped me to find a place to fit in.\"'},\n",

Language is a big part of today\\'s world and many do not appreciate a bad word. They put these in movies to emphasize somthing big because everyone will remember that word. I know that it is not necessary all of the time and could be taken out, but for some movies a certain word could make or break the scene. Some movies have a lot of cursing in them but that does not make it a bad movie. A few of the best movies I have ever seen have too many bad words to count but the stroy line is phenominal. What you gain from watching those movies is not the cursing, it\\'s the success of the protagonist that makes it enjoyable and worth your time.     As for books in libraries, we should make a seperate section for these offensive materials so that a young, innocent child does not wonder across them. Put up signs warning people of the material contained in that section and put a speical sticker on the book to warn parents as well.

These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view?      First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It is possible for anything to offend anyone.  Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writter and the followers of the writter. Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves. If offending others is the issue then would it not be better to leave it alone over all, rather than making it an issue to please one group but inturn upsetting another?      Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view? If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending other we could not have much of the knowledge we have today. For example a biology book might be offensive to people whos religion explains things differently and would make things untrue, and a religous document such as \\'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2\\' or \\'The @CAPS3\\' could be offensive to the people who believe the biology books to be true. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science. This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive.      As a solution,  I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is pleased another is offended. If that person is pleased then the first person is offended. If books could possibly labeled as\\'some might take offensive\\' or \\'material @MONTH1 be offensive\\' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not. If they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a warning. It would  be just like the parental warnings on cd\\'s. This @MONTH1 not fix the problem of people being offended, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive.     In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive. Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning. That is just not an opition. Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves @MONTH1 cause contraversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are preformed, the issues should decrease greatly. Think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves\"'},\n",

The book in general is a rather appeasing book, it\\'s just some things, people might take offense to. That doesn\\'t mean the book shouldn\\'t belong on shelves.     I don\\'t think that libraries should be forced to take books off shelves just because they offended someone. That\\'s like saying you should shoot everyone who has made an offensive comment to somebody in their life, you would be left with nothing in the end. If someone finds the things that other people have to say, offensive, they generally stop hanging out with that person. Therefore, it would only make sense for someone to stop reading a book if they find it offensive.     Some magazines have really offensive things in them, that people in the real world say. It\\'s not like your generic non-fiction books that come up with insulting things to say, at a high school level. You don\\'t have to subscirbe to that particular magazine, or even pick it up to read. These days, so many things offend so many people, in so many different ways. What might offend @PERSON1 down the street, @PERSON2 across town might find funny.You cannot make everyone happy, and if you took books off the shlef because someone complained about the offensive things that they read, you would be trying to appease to everyones\\' wants and needs.     I think it would be fair to put a restriction on books, about age limits. Some of the more offensive ones could have the higher age limits. At the junior high I attended, they have books categorized as \\'young adult\\' books, which means you either have to be in eighth grade or have a note from your guardian saying that it\\'s alright for you to read those types of books. It\\'d be just like movies; movies have the ratings so that only certain people can watch them, why can\\'t they do the same with books?     I guess what I am trying to say is that it would be very disappointing to me and numerous other people if you just started taking books, @CAPS7, movies, magazines, and so on, off the shelves, and out of market just because someone cried foul against it. If they don\\'t like the material that they are looking at, reading, watching, listening to, or all the above, no @CAPS1 is forcing them to pay attention to it. They can go read the nursery rhymes, because those are not offenesive.

Because all people have different views on life, different beliefs, and different feelings, @CAPS4 makes @CAPS4 hard for libraries to please everyone. There are also different genres that people enjoy reading. Some @MONTH1 enjoy romance and comedy, while others like to read action books or mysteries.     Today, libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials. They have kids, fiction, informational, and many more. They also have different areas where you can find movies or magazines. But, if there are magazines, books, or movies, that should be viewed only by certain ages, the library should put a warning sign in the areas where those materials are located.      On the back of movies there is a rateing on @CAPS1 bad the movie is. Why not put a rateing on the back of books and magazines? This way people can know what to expect if they read @CAPS4. @CAPS4 would also help them decide if they even want to read @CAPS4. Rateings on the back of magazines and books would help destinguish what age is appropriate for @CAPS4.      Once, when i was visiting the library, there was a man in the check out line, right before me. @CAPS3 was returning the book that @CAPS3 had just read and checking out the new one @CAPS3 had already picked out. When @CAPS4 was finally his turn in line @CAPS3 stepped up to the counter and explained to the sweet, old, lady at the front desk, what @CAPS3 had wanted to do with his books. She simply understood that @CAPS3 wanted to check out and return one. As she was checking him out she was making small talk and asked, \\'@CAPS1 did you like your book, @CAPS2?\\' @CAPS3 replied \\' @CAPS4 wasn\\'t what i expected. @CAPS4 was completly inappropriate. \\' As they disscussed a little more @CAPS4 turned out that there were tons of curse words throughout the entire book. This is one example of @CAPS1 people don\\'t know what to expect when they read a book.      I don\\'t think that libraries should remove materials off the shelves that people have complained about. They should simply do something to let people know what to expect when they read the books, magazines, or movies. Some people @MONTH1 not mind reading a book with a few curse words here and there, but others @MONTH1 find @CAPS4 outragous. Libraries spend their money to buy these books for the communities. Why take a book off if only a few people find @CAPS4 offensive? No one makes those people read those books, its by their choice. Libraries need to figure out some way to reasure people that they will enjoy what they are reading and not be offended by @CAPS4\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\"Dear @CAPS1, The things we learn at such a young age really need to be changed. It would really help soicity.Here are some ways how.      All books are diffrent. Some @MONTH1 have offencive language. If books have offenceive language you dont have to read it outloud. You can always substitute other words in there for those or just skip over them like nothing happened.     Some books say sexual things in them that @MONTH1 offend a race of some type or a gender. If books are sexual for your age group then I would recomend choosing a new book. But no matter how you look at it. It could always be much worse than what it is.     Music music needs to be some cencorship on that. When your listening to the radio or a cd or ipod. You cant always censor that. the radio compianies need to do a better job at censoring them out of songs. Many young teens think its cool to use vulgor language.      Movies have diffrent ratings for diffrent age group. I\\'m sure no one would let a two year old watch a rated @CAPS2 movie. That kid would have nightmares for a week. so censorship woukd really help the parents out on choosing the right movie for family night instead of picking one that they have no clue about.           Magazines are nothing but gossip. Most magazines do nothing but talk about the bad in people or the good in them.There should be some censorship in there because it is a persons life who there talking garbage.      Some say kids are like sponges. Whatever the kid hears he will repeat. Whatever a kid sees he will try to repeat it. So whatever a kid reads or watches will probably be the same.      Things do need a little censorship. If we didnt have that its hard telling what the world would be like. The world would be full of a lot of people with no motivation what so ever and if we take things away then the world would have nothing to do.I know that when I was a little kid I would hear somthing on the radio and think it was cool to say. My parents would\\'nt know what to do to me. I kjnow as an adult i would\\'nt want my kids learning the stuff I did at such a young age.\"'},\n",

For instance, if you are an adult you will most likely be looking in the adult section. There @MONTH1 be children who look through that same section, although their parents should be monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries.              Although maturity has a lot to do with it, some young adult books probably aren\\'t intended for the people reading them.

I don\\'t think the adult section at the libraries should be monitored all that much, because as an adult you are free to make your own decisions. You know whats right and whats wrong, and no one person should have to tell you what you should or shouldn\\'t be reading.     The area that I would be most concerned with would be the young adult section. At that point children are at an awkward growing stage were they themselves are still learning whats right and wrong. Some books or movies could effect the young viewers dramatically. Their parents @MONTH1 be letting them watch horrific movies, and it could make them feel as if what they\\'re watching is really okay. I think parents should be very involved in their children\\'s lives, and closely monitor what their children are reading or watching.     I do feel that some books should be monitored, and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age. Mostly in the children and young adult sections, because they could be taking in information they shouldn\\'t be.

       "  'content_text': '\"Can you believe that some people think that books should be banned for having bad things in them? Well I can, Children today are learning nothing but violence and cursing these days. Banned books could be the way we set them stait and make them recognise that stuff is bad.      Only a handfull of kids these days are choosing to read books, a majority of them are playing video games and watching tv. Chilren shouldn\\'t be alloud to swear, or think that violence is alright. Chilren will read these bad books and think it is ok to shoot someone if they are doing something they don\\'t like, but it\\'s not alright. Banned books are exaclty what children need when they are in their younger years.     Banned books might have foul language and violence, but I believe that it is ok to let your teen or young adault read them if they are mature enough to handle it. Teenagers should be mature enough to be able to read a book with a few swear words in it, or someone killing another person. Some banned books don\\'t even have swear words in them; \\'@CAPS1 @CAPS2\\' doesn\\'t have one swear word in any of the books but still it remains on the banned books list to this day.      Some books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed for profanity and drugs. I do believe that someone is trying to make a difference with the banned books list. Censorship should only be used if a person is too young to understand why or what is happening when they say a bad word or do something confusing.      In conclusion I think censorship is a great thing that should be used moderatly. The children today dont need to be learning about sex, drugs, swearing, violence, etc. I do believe if they put an age limit on what you can watch/read that it will be a more controlled topic to talk about.\"'},\n",

No it is not the whole situation of wether or not libraries should have things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to certain people due to there age should not be an issue.  My reasoning on that is not because of how it @MONTH1 influence people in a bad way.  Then again it @MONTH1 influence them in a fantastic way.          Thats how people find out who they are such as, what their interested in, what they like, and what they want to do.  If it wasnt for establishments such as libraries most people would be the same as the others and not have a sense of character to themselves. People would be to similar and have little to no differences to themselves from others.  People should be aware of some of the content in books. Just not to the point were those areas become restricted to certain age groups.  Movies and cds are more understandable do to the actual graphic violence and language that some musicans and actors @MONTH1 use.  Except in a book its not what other people are doing and saying its what you yourself is reading and how you yourself is interperating it.  It takes more than what some people are doing and saying to reflect on what your reading and how your reading it.     Thats why the whole situation of wether or not libraries certain things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to a certain age group, but instead having the ares labeled on what the category is to know before looking.

The main character in the story, Saeng, is a @CAPS1 immigrant. Because @CAPS2 is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance when she sees the flower �Madagascar penwinhle� she thinks �how strange to see it in a pot� because �Back home it just grows wild,� The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says �and the geese return,� because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their pattern are becoming familiar. The very last line says �I will take that test again.� This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver�s test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus Saeng observes that �the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it. Despite the difficulty, though, she �Dug out a hole� and knows it�s strong enough to move it through the cold months just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saeng�s character.  \"'},\n",

I love those times that you laugh so hard your stomach starts aching really bad.  First, one of my most recent memorable laughing moments I spent with my mom that I don\\'t see often. So this moment meant a lot to me as you can imagine. The last time she came to see my older brother and I we went bowling. She brought her friend down with her as well. My brother and I hadn\\'t bowled in a very long time, but we knew we would still beat them. It turns out my mom beat me though. We had a lot of great laughs over that, actually I think that was the first time I wasn\\'t a sore loser. Although, I\\'m still not sure how she beat me, she would through the ball down the lane sideways and some how it would go right down the middle. When you have moments like these, that you can look back on to help you through the hard times, it\\'s really inspirational. All in all we had some really great laughs that day that were shared with my mom.  Another memorable laughing moment was spent with my dad and brother. Every once in awhile my dad, brother and I sit in our living room and talk about several different things, some good and some bad. They can be about my mom, school, our animals or all three of our compassion for sports. These talks always mean a lot to me because we never spend much time together. We don\\'t get to spend much time together because my brother and me are always at school or in some kind of sport and my dad is always at work. These conversations have several effects on me sometimes they are sad and other times they make me feel better about things. There are so many laughable moments just in our living room. One thing we always like to laugh about is the way my dad always says album. For some reason he thinks he has to add another @CAPS1 in front of the @CAPS2 so it spells alblum. My brother and I enjoy making fun of him for that but we all have our moments we like to laugh at each other for. That was just one of the many things we love to laugh about.  Sometimes laughter is a very important part in someones life. For someone who is on the edge, or upset, just saying something little to make them smile or laugh makes all the difference in the world. Laughter is a great way to make people feel loved and excepted, also a great way to put people back on track when they\\'re down. I know smiles and laughing makes me feel so much better inside. I hope you have had some great laughing moments spent with the people you love and care about.\"'},\n",

Could it be that we have crossed the line and are no longer protecting the children, but are instead holding back our society as a whole?  In my opinion, censorship of literature has crossed the line.     A library is, essentially, an incredably valuable resource to each generation.  In some cases it still is, but when books are being with held do to the fact that it @MONTH1 offend someone we are holding people back from the knowledge they could gain from the work of literature itself.  We attempt to placate everyone in today\\'s society, therefore we censor several things that are not politically correct.  If future generations are unable to learn what we have through these writings, then they will lack the insight we had gained.     Another reason is, to be perfectly honest, history and society have not- and very well @MONTH1 never truly be- politically correct.  People take umbrage to certain words and consequently some libraries will remove the book featuring said words from their shelves.  After this is done, what have we really accomplished?       Have we made the world a better place by attempting to hide a part of history?  That is debatable, but by the same token, in school we must learn about the @CAPS1 despite the fact that it upsets many people.  We must learn about this because it was an important part in history that needs to be remembered in hopes that nothing so terrible as that will ever happen again.  So, if we learn about an entire subject which happened in another country but effected the entire world should we not learn about our own faults in history?  The times we have oppressed people, the terms we used so commonly we attempt to hide now.       Has it really helped us?  No, for until people recognize a problem and furthermore are reminded of how wrong it was they will not understand it.  Napoleon once said that history is a story written by the victor, but is victory so sweet after our history has been rewritten?     If everything that offends people is censored or taken away we will have nothing left.  For if one person is aloud to say what is and isn\\'t acceptable then others will partake in this as well.  It would become a new fad and people would find a problem with just about anything.     So, essentially, by censoring works in libraries we are holding back the future generations from all that they could be.  We are forcing them to be ignorant of society\\'s problems.  In the end we must ask ourselves, was it really worth it?  I remind you, a library is an invaluable resource.\"'},\n",

I think it is ok for people to write whatever thay want because it\\'s a free contruy to where you can do anything that you tink you can do. What I am trying to say is that people can write books how ever thay want with anything in it such as drugs, sex, abuse, bad language, and so on you get what I\\'m saying. I think it\\'s ok to write whatever they want and put whatever it was they wrote about on the shelf. It\\'s they person who is picking a book choose to read a book just because they don\\'t like what the book was about they don\\'t have to make a big deal about it and cause a problem. People can just not pick the book up and look for another book.     I don\\'t think it\\'s fear that people should make a big deal out of a book that they don\\'t have to read at all it makes no since to me and I bet a lot of people would agree. If I was someone who was a aganised stuff like sex, and drugs and I saw it in a book I would just set it down and look for a book that I would agree with than causing a problem like others would. It just is not fare and it\\'s a waist of time to me if someone has to complane about something so dumb.     So to rap this thing up I think people who don\\'t like the way books are writen should just put it down and not worry about it and buy a book that they feel better off with reading.

People were thrilled for this idea, yet they knew how difficult this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler building\\'s builders tactic about sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith was not going to let that happen so he decided to make the @CAPS1.S.B. even taller. (1,250 ft.) secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as and obsticle because at such a height, construction is hard to do. Al Smith was more than determined though which enlightened the workers stated in paragraph @NUM1, \"\"over sixty thousand dollars\"\" worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework (L�sted, @NUM1). Also, the dock or landing dock, could not be used weather permitting. The dirigibles so close to the city, building, and civilians was dangerous when swaying around. The author says, \"\"some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City\"\" (6). There were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast. Last of all, an existing law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble. All and all, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the dock to become successful in society.\"'},\n",

To Narciso and his whole entire family, family is the most important thing. No one leaves a family member out. In his neighborhood there mostly lived, Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. All these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso\\'s parents came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. When I read this memoir I felt happy reading it. It let me know how other families who really have nothing, have everything. Narciso\\'s family is very close, and caring for one another, and to them family is the only thing that matters.\"'},\n",

Narciso is very grateful for his heritage and is a proud cuban.

Another thing that Narciso is extremely grateful for is his family. His family moved up to @LOCATION1 before he was born so that their children could have a better life. They have sacrificed so much for their children including social and financial sacrifices. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso writes, \"\"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\"\" Any sane human being would be grateful to have parents that did what Narciso\\'s parents did for him.

       "  'content_text': '\"  Being with people that can always make you feel comfortable and be yourself around is most likely the best quality in a friend. Everyone has their flaws; a friend can always look past them and find the good in the one that they trust. A friend can tell a joke and make you laugh until you cry. Making someone laugh can always help when they think that it\\'s not possible for their life to get any worse. Laughter is the most valued gift that can be given. You know inside that it\\'s making them happy just from seeing the smile on their face. There have been many times in my life where I have laughed so hard that I cried. There is truly no greater feeling in the world than knowing that you have people in your life that can cheer you up just by doing or even saying something so ridiculous that it just breaks you into a hysterical laughter. I laugh a lot throughout the day. When I don\\'t, people get suspicious and they feel like there\\'s something wrong with me. That\\'s literally how much of a role that laughing plays in my life. Laughing is my second language in life. There has been one time in particular in my life span so far that has made me laugh so hard that I cried tremendously hard. My friends were staying the @TIME1 at my house and we were just being boys. We did so many things that mad us question our sanity: we at hot sauce by the spoon full, we watched comedy shows, and we also ate ourselves sick. It was the time of a lifetime and we laughed through it all. While watching the comedy shows, we couldn\\'t breath. We were laughing so hard! Nothing could make me stop laughing; I would just keep replaying every joke in my head and I\\'d start laughing even more. I already hurt so much as it was when we were watching it from earlier. The comedian was a magician with words; the way he put them all together to just seemed like he was reading a sacred scroll from ancient times. I laughed and cried over and over again. I probably did that for ten minutes straight! It was unbelievable. Making these life-long memories with my friends is something that I will never forget. I truly know how great I have it in my life; people would kill to be in my shoes and to get the love and support I get from my friends and family. All my experiences are the things I learn from, whether they\\'re good or bad, I know that its all going to help me later in life to be able to make the right decision when it is presented to me. All the laughs i share with other people makes me know that they have had a good time throughout their day because they smiled and laughed with me. They made a point in my day great as well. Being myself around them is great as well because I know that they\\'re already accepted me into their lives and I don\\'t have to try to be anyone else.  Everyone laughs at some point or another throughout their lives no matter how much they deny it. I really don\\'t even know why they would because what better feeling is there than being able to let out a little giggle every once in a while? I really don\\'t think that there is any. I feel really honored that I have such amazing people in my life that always make it exciting and full of laughter and life. It shouldn\\'t be any other way in my personal opinion. Live life to the fullest; why would you want to live it any other way?\"'},\n",

People who do drugs or have a family member that does drugs are an example. A better example would be the parents or gaurdians of a kid who was killed either by accident or on purpose. One of the most common but overlooked examples is the what the loved ones of people who die serving our country go through. As you can see if people can live with that then we can definantly handle an offensive book.      Censorship causes blidness. What I mean is, if we censor one offensive book then we have to censor every book that someone finds offensive. All men are created equal, right? So they\\'d have to censor the book.

The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Instead of becoming the transportation of the future the idea had disappeared.

When your going to build a 1,250 foot building and have a air craft land on it, you need a good and well designed frame.  What they did was add a stainless steal and chrome-nickle windows to cut down on pressure.  They spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the skeleton of the Empire State building.  The other main issue was the air currents.  You can not strapp a dirigible and believe the back of it swaying back and worth.  When your almost a 11 @NUM1 ft in the air, the wind can be very violent at that height.  If the dirigible ever came off or unhooked before they were done refueling, the dirigible would crash and burn, hundreds of pedestrian on the ground below.

The sheltered must learn one day, and if kids learn now about the truth, such as, not to stick forks in outlets, then they won\\'t be as curious when they are older. Being sheltered is not always a good thing and censor ship of what we read, watch, or listen to is ridculous, and disrespectful to authors.          In matters of censorship, I find it to be pointless. Censorship doesn\\'t prevent your kids from learning about anything, except mother won\\'t let me watch that. it just keeps your kids more curious and more obligated to hide things from you and like they cannot ask you questions or be open and honest with you.

I believe censorship should be illegal not required.          Sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing, and discovering the real world. The idea that the world has no evil, or hiding the evil from your children will in most cases cause them to rebel and in other cases leave them unprepared for the future and the real world. Wouldn\\'t you rather be able to help your kids and teach them about things instead of tell them that everything is perfect and only bad people use that kind of language. Or make them feel like a bad person for do something your grandparents did when they were young?      I conclude that censorship is injust, unfair, and is the real wrong. Not the profanity or the violence that will one day be apart of their life in some way. You don\\'t go through everyday in the \\'real world\\' with a mindset of there\\'s nothing wrong in this world.

I think somethings should not be on the shelves of a library because some books can be found very offensive to some people. Even movies and music can be offensive to some people. I think the music of @DATE1 is a big problem because the lyrics can be very offensive. Movies are not a huge issue but they can be at times.      There are many reasons movies can be offensive. If they are offensive why put them in the libraries? Well the libraries just want to make money so they do not care about offensive products. For example a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movie that is inaccurrate and poorly made might be offensive to real life @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 veterans. The veterans then might want the movie taken of the shelves. I have seen some great @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movies but I have also see some bad ones too. My grandpa was a veteran and he saw a bad @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and got so upset he cursed at the @CAPS15 and almost threw the remote at it.      Then ther is the problem with the music of @DATE1. I do not think stores including libraries should sell albums of @DATE1\\'s rap artists because all the talk about is drugs, sex, and girls. If you ask me its stupid. But when you start selling them in a library there is something wrong with that librariy. Some country singers can be like that to because all the sing about is getting drunk then having sex. I just think the most of the music of @DATE1 is really pointless and a waste of time because when I listen to it I think this is stupid and makes no sinces.     Books can be offensive sometimes it just depends on the writer. Books with a lot of cursing can be offensive to religions groups who are forbidden to curse or read curse words. Why put it on the shelves of libraries then? Well it all lead back to money. If people buy the books that mean the libraries get money and the more books people buy the richer the libraries becomes. I read a book that was about some one killing cats and I found that offensive because I love cats I would never hurt them. I got really mad when I read it so I threw it down the took it to the library and complained to them.     So over all the libraries should be more carefull on what they put on the shelves for people to buy. If the libraries but the wrong things on the shelves they might end up in a law suit.

By the time we finished telling stories it had reached @TIME2 and everyone in the house was either tired or hungry.  As we sat on the floor complaining about tiredness or hunger we all started to turn our attention to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 was starting to go on a tirade about how hungry she was. In her opinion she thought the house we were staying in should of already been stoked with food for us for when we got @CAPS2, but @CAPS2 was no food. As she continued on her rant she became more and more mad which made us laugh harder and harder. Finally she reached her point. \"\"@CAPS2\\'s no steak or chicken up in these mother freak-in cabinets.\"\" @PERSON1 proclaimed. At that point the coaches and players started laughing uncontrollable. @PERSON1 didn\\'t understand why it was so funny, but we kept laughing and laughing at the fact that she just said that @CAPS2 should be steak and chicken in the cabinets. The outburst of laughter continued on for the next five to ten minutes.  When we finally started to calm down @PERSON2 came down stairs. She had missed everything that had happened and as we went to fill her in @LOCATION1 stopped us. \"\"@PERSON2 @CAPS4 up on the counter and look in the cabinet,\"\" @PERSON1 said. @PERSON2 hesitantly got up on the counter and slowly started to open the cabinet. When she opened the cabinet she looked inside and all she could see was chips. She turned around and looked at @LOCATION1. \"\"@CAPS3?\"\" asked @PERSON2. As she turned to @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 just sat @CAPS2 smiling. Then she finally answered the question. \"\"@CAPS4 me some of those chips right @CAPS2!\"\" @PERSON1 said.  Everyone in the room started laughing as @PERSON2 was so confused to why she was asked to @CAPS4 on a counter just so she could @CAPS4 @PERSON1 chips, who had been sitting next to the counter the whole @TIME1. The whole basketball team started laughing again. @PERSON2 got down from the counter but with no chips in hand. We all continued laughing and kept talking about @CAPS3 had just happened for the next @NUM1 minutes.  As everyone finally started to settle into their beds for the @TIME1 @CAPS2 were still those moments of \"\"@CAPS5 when this was said\"\", and \"\"@CAPS5 when she did this\"\". That first @TIME1 that we spent at the beach did more for us then we realized. By going to the beach and making memories together we were brought together by two common things. The love for basketball, and most of all the ability to be able to come together as a team all because of the memories we shared that @TIME1 in the kitchen. Today we still @CAPS4 on each others nerves and sometimes we lose our tempers with another but, we will always laugh about the crazy things that happened on the trip but the thing we laugh about the most is @CAPS3 happened that @TIME1 in the kitchen.   \"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\" Laughter is one of the best things people can learn to do. Laughter is one of the many things I enjoy doing. I love how everyone has their own distinctive laugh, some are loud and some are quiet almost like a giggle. Not only do I enjoy it but I love that is helps me relieve stress, which is a major part of relationships. My boyfriend and I met about three years ago. Today we have been going out for a year and three months. We met whenI was mowing my yard, and my neighbor @LOCATION1 brought him over to introduce us to each other. I mean she couldn\\'t have brought him over at a worse time; I was hot and sweaty because it was eighty degrees out side, I had no make-up on, and I smelled like fresh cut grass what a great first impression huh? \"\"@CAPS1 @CAPS2 this is @PERSON1\"\" she said with a smile. \"\"@CAPS3 timing @CAPS4\"\" I replied with a tone of anger in my voice. \"\"sorry\"\" she said, \"\"but he said he wanted to meet you , and he wouldn\\'t shut up about it.\"\" I looked over at him and noticed that he blushed a little and I laughed. From then on I knew that @PERSON1 and I were going to have something great together. Till this day our relationship is stronger than ever, and it\\'s because we can make each other laugh. Now don\\'t get me wrong, trust, honesty, communication, listening, are all still a big part and those are important too, but I think that having humor and being able to laugh in a relationship is one of the key things to a healthy and long lasting relationship. My boyfriend and I have great sense of humor, and we defiantly like to use it in our relationship. I could have the worst day of my life;and when I talk to him on the phone I know my day is going to change from horrible to fantastic. Just because I know that within the first few minutes of talking to him and hearing his voice, he\\'s going to say something funny and I can\\'t help but to laugh. I honestly believe you need a good sense of humor in your relationship if you want it to last. When you don\\'t have laughter in your relationship, it tends to get very dull and boring. You can\\'t be serious twenty-four seven, that\\'s way too stressful. Since laughter helps relieve stress, you will defiantly need it during your relationship so it doesn\\'t get stressful and turn into nothing but a bunch of fighting and arguing. So in conclusion, I know your thoughts about what I just talked about might not be the same, but I hope after reading this you will be more willing to consider my opinions on the subject of laughter in a relationship, based on being able to enjoy and know what laughter is, and also how great of a thing it is. How it relieves stress, if you have a bunch of stress in your relationship try cracking a couple jokes you will be amazed at what a little bit of laughing can do. Especially if you want to keep your relationship with your significant other happy, fun, and not only that but also full of life. Laughter is bliss\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\"One @MONTH1 walk into a library, look over at a magzine rack and think, \\'@CAPS1 is that in the young adult section, the content of that book is not age appropriate?\\' In many libraries, some books are not censored and catagorized the way they should. In some of the reading material, one might not even realize that some inappropriate things are in it. Supervision of children and young adults are not always looked upon, and some of these people might not even know what they are checking out. Censorship needs to be pushed more in libraries.      In most libraries, the catagories for books are children, young adult, adult books by genere, magazines, and music, but what needs looked upon is what is on the inside covers of those books. Some magazine articles are not appropriate for some teens, even if it does claim to be age appropriate. I remember when I was fourteen, I read a series that was related to colors off the color weel. Each one covered a different topic such as suicide, alcholism, drugs, sex, same sex dating, and jealousy. Looking back on it, I am surprised I was allowed to check them out at the library. A fourteen year old didn\\'t need to read books on such heavy topics.Also, language in books and music maybe unappropriate for children, and @MONTH1 be distasteful and disrespectful for some adults. The catagories need to be catogorized even more, so people further know what they are getting into when checking out a book or magazine.      When a child goes up to check out a book they found, a librarian sometimes doesn\\'t even pay attention to the book they are getting, they simply check it out. Libraries should have a rating system like movies do. Generally people would not let their ten-year-old go to a movie rated @NUM1, @CAPS2 or that is unrated, so @CAPS1 would they let their child get a book holding the same content? If books had a rating system, that ten-year- old would not get their hands on a book rated \\'@CAPS2\\' or \\'@CAPS4\\' for mature.     In libraries there is not as much supervision as their needs to be. I am aware that libraries are not day-care center and the librarians are not babysitters, but there also needs to be stricter guidelines, because some people are not fully aware of what their children or what they, themselves, are reading. For example, a thirteen-year-old girl wants to check out @CAPS5 magazine, because her best friend\\'s older sister gets it. The girl\\'s mother allows it because it probably won\\'t be too bad and she assumes her daughter wants to look at the pictures of new clothes and trends. What the mother @MONTH1 not realize is in the middle of the magazine contains an article about sex and protection, and that @MONTH1 open a whole new world for the little girl. Even though the mother shouldn\\'t have had let her daughter check out the magazine, if the guidelines were stricter at the library the girl might have never have read that article. Even if librarians had to check or scan a person\\'s library card to make sure they can be in the section or be reading a certain book, it would be protecting many more people then it would be hurting.     If libraries censored books better, then children and teens @MONTH1 not be reading things not age appropriate to them. I\\'@CAPS4 not saying that books should be removed off the shelf, just maybe put up higher, and be watched over more carefully\"'},\n",

Another obstacle was nature, due to the winds on top of the Empire State Building it was hard to bring the dirigibles remotely close to the mast. Yet another obstacle facing the builders of the mast was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Overall, the idea could not be projected into a real-life, visual interpretation because of the obstacles faced by the builders of the mast, now people have airplanes and airports to dock the planes - theres no use for the mast on top of the Empire State Building regarding aviation.\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\" My friend @PERSON1 and I have @CAPS1 friends from as back as sixth grade. We have @CAPS1 through so much together. Even though we don\\'t have everything in common and we don\\'t hang out, out side of school together, we have a lot of laughter in our friendship. I say that if you are gonna have a friendship that is gonna last, you have to have laughter in it to make it a fun friendship. When @PERSON1 and I where in @NUM1 grade, we where the biggest people to the sixth graders because we where in the highest grade in our middle school. We would have so much stuff to do. @PERSON1 and I would always walk down the hallways linking our arms together and one moment after another she would just push me into someone. That someone would plow into a locker or wall and we would just laugh are butts off. It was fun to us but the other people kinda minded, but not that bad.  Another thing we would do to make our self laugh would be when @PERSON1 and I would have big tickle fights. It would always start with one of us trying to stick something in each others mouths. I would always try to stick a piece of paper in her mouth and to get me to stop, @PERSON1 would tickle me. @PERSON1 new that I\\'m like the ticklish person on the face of the planet. One time that happened was when we where in front of the office at our school. We tickled and tickled each other till we where laughing our butts off on the flour. Well a teacher came and told us to stop and then the bell rang and so we just went to our classes. Well @PERSON1 was the office aid and so when she went to the office, apparently one of the office people saw us tickling each other and thought we where going out. @PERSON1 told me that she just said \"\"@CAPS3\"\" and started to chuckle. I got a big laugh out of that. Laughter is a vary good thing to me because without it, @PERSON1 and I wouldn\\'t be best friends as we are today in @NUM2 grade. You see, our friendship all started off of laughter. I met @PERSON1 in the sixth grade @CAPS4 class. Our teacher had assigned seats and @PERSON1 and I and two other people had to sit together. I had no idea who she was at the time. We ended up saying something and laughing about it and soon enough she introduced her self and so did I. Well the seating arrangement changed and she sat somewhere ells and so did I. Well the person she sat by moved away. I had a bad grade in @CAPS4 class and I told my teacher I wasn\\'t getting along with the people at my table and asked if I could sit somewhere ells. He told me yes and so I went over and asked @PERSON1 if I could sit in the empty chair that the guy used to sit in before he moved away. She told me that she didn\\'t care and so then on out we started hanging in school together and had so much fun.  So you see. Laughter is a grate deal in a lot of peoples life\\'s. You need it. Without it I would of never made my best friend who I have today. I have her to thank for getting me through my tough years. Without the laughter in this world we would be lost probably. Just think about what you might not have or what you might be missing if you didn\\'t have laughter in your life.\"'},\n",

By that means, laughing has an enormous impact on each and every one of us throughout our everyday lives. Laughter tends to enlighten our emotions by expressing them in many good, cheerful, and lastly, positive ways. However, @CAPS4 is proven that laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze.When laughter is shared, @CAPS4 binds people together and increases the intimacy and happiness. Around @TIME1--which happens to be exactly when my third period class begins, I was supposed to be in my @CAPS1 class at the time, but with my luck--I wasn\\'t. You are probably thinking, \"\"@CAPS2, if she is not in her third period class, then where is she?\"\" I actually ended up in the computer lab, beginning my state writing test once again. I defiantly wasn\\'t too thrilled about taking the writing test over again, but in my heart, I knew deep down inside that I could pass the state writing test this time without any if, and, or buts, which are also known as the worst things ever--excuses. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could of done better--that\\'s for sure. My self confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negatives thoughts to think of. I was ready to face the test--once again. As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost nearly sat down as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter. I took an immense deep breath--like usual, and began to log into the computer. In between the time I was waiting for my computer to get logged in, I sat there gazing around the room, with nothing more to do, then to visualize what I was going to type my state writing test about. Once the teacher approved my log-in, I started typing all of my private information into the blank squares, so that I could begin my next steps.Within seconds I was ready to begin my test. On the screen appeared several topics that were listed below to choose from, but there was only one of them that I felt most satisfied with, and that I felt I could score exceedingly high in. The topic was, \"\"We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, \"\"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.\"\" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was on element or part.\"\"  The minute I selected that subject, I honestly had no idea what I was going to write about because during my childhood life I had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, and nearly every story that I could remember had to of been more than @NUM1 words. So, I quietly sat there thinking-- just how I knew I would be.  During the moment, I heard this very irritating sound, which was the from the many taps from the kid\\'s keyboards, and numerous annoying clicks from the computer mouses. @CAPS4 was very obvious that the students understood their topic quite @CAPS2--unlike me.  Minutes had flew by so quickly, and yet, still nothing. Not a single story to share about laughter. By then, I was very upset with myself, because if you really think about @CAPS4, who does not have a story to write about that deals with laughter? I knew I had some sort or kind of story to share, @CAPS4 was just harder for me to summarize one up and type about @CAPS4.  Just then, as I was going to begin my essay, a younger student, (that had been taking a state reading test), loudly shouted, \"\"@CAPS3!\"\" The little kid not only caught myself, but the rest of the class as @CAPS2. I honestly swear @CAPS4 was a \"\"had to of been there moments.\"\" @CAPS4 wasn\\'t just for the fact that he said @CAPS3 exceedingly loud, but the expression that was on his face, and the way he announced @CAPS4 to everyone in the computer lab--@CAPS4 nearly killed me inside. The little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed. Obviously he was very eager to let the entire class know--which is probably something I would have done as @CAPS2.  Almost as quickly as he announced @CAPS4, I knew this was a laughing moment to not only remember, but to share with others as @CAPS2. In fact, if truth be told, this short story just so happened to not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assessment topic many times less stressing for me. Clearly as you can see, laughing indeed does seem to have an enormous impact on each and everyone of us throughout our everyday lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared.\"'},\n",

Everyone was going to @LOCATION2 for the biggest concert any one has ever been to. Only the students in eighth grade in either band, choir, jazz band, or jazz choir were able to go; if @CAPS16 didn\\'t pay all your funds, then @CAPS16 were left behind. We were going to a hotel, attending a concert, and going to a @CAPS4 @CAPS5.   My friends, @PERSON3, @PERSON2, and @PERSON4 were without a doubt excited. We have never been on the longest road trip till then. @CAPS3 seemed to have taken days to get to @LOCATION2. We left at five in the morning with over one hundred kids packed into two buses. One bus was for the boys and one for the girls, yet there were more girls then boys so we split the boys bus.   I was stuck sitting with @CAPS6. @CAPS6 is a nice girl, but @CAPS3 was difficult to start conversations with her. @CAPS17 wanted to be back home in @LOCATION1. I never found out why @CAPS17 was so upset; which made my ride there unbelievably boring. Until @PERSON3\\'s accident. @CAPS17 snorted a pretzel up her nose. Overall @CAPS17 was okay and everyone besides @CAPS6 laughed along with her.   By the third hour of sitting in a cramped bus, us girls had to go to the bathroom. Complaining to the bus driver @CAPS17 replied, \"\"We\\'re almost to the pit stop. Just another hour or so.\"\" The choir girls began singing about going to the bathroom. Soon the bus was filled with our melodious song and laughter. Finally @CAPS8, the bus driver, pulled over. A line of dancing girls bulged out of the bathroom laughing at each other.   Once we were done we said our farewells to the boys as they piled onto the bus and took off. \"\"@CAPS9 down. Lets get to @LOCATION2.\"\" @CAPS8 said. We cheered as we drove off. Four hours later, we were stopped yet again, at another gas station eating our lunch. The boys were fine with how much progress we made; starting calling everyone of us girls the boys were getting annoying. Us girls ignored all calls from boys for the rest of our trip. Finally we got to our hotel.  At the hotel the boys got the top story while the girls got the lower story near the swimming pool. When dinner came along @PERSON1, our music director, aloud everyone to roam around the stores near by and buy our dinners. Luckily we were near @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and a numerous amount of fast food places. @PERSON4 and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 while @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 got our drinks; since we didn\\'t want @ORGANIZATION1 drinks they went to @ORGANIZATION3 to buy @CAPS11. We met back at our room with our goods. We gorged ourselves till our abdomens seemed to explode. Dancing her way into the bathroom, @PERSON3 apeard with a broom as her dancing partner. Our laughter filled the room. We partied on till we realized we had a concert to attend.   We had two hours till the concert and thirty dollars was missing. @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I searched our room almost missing breakfast and ending up empty handed. When we found the girls across the hall all except one of them were there. The remaining girls looked at each other. \"\" @CAPS6 was out of money yesterday and now all of the sudden @CAPS17 has money to buy food. We\\'re missing fifty dollars.\"\" @CAPS13 replied. @PERSON1 then came in, \"\"@CAPS14 up. We got a concert to attend.\"\" @CAPS15 at each other with disapointment we all left.  Running to the back stage door I dropped my music. @PERSON2 laughed picking @CAPS3 up. \"\"@CAPS16\\'ll do great.\"\" @CAPS17 said smiling. I smiled back, \"\"@CAPS18 @CAPS16.\"\" I turned and stepped out onto the empty stage and took my seat in the front of the band. Picking up my flute I began my solo. The soft chords filled my ears as I imagined myself alone. Although I was nervous my stage fright gracefully vanished.   I ran out the auditorium doors. Girls and boys laughing with me as we raced to the buses. The bus drivers hurried their way to the @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Once we were there, @PERSON1 payed for everyone and we were off. Laughing at ourselves @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I screamed at the top of our lungs when the @CAPS19 shock dropped. When the ride was over, we all laughed seeming to have come @CAPS2.  I didn\\'t want to leave, but I knew I had to. Everyone piled back on the bus and called our parents to let them know we were coming home. Laughing at every mistake we made, @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I took a group picture to remember the trip. Some how amongst the trip we laughed together at everything. Nothing stood in our way when we laughed. In the end laughing @CAPS1 us @CAPS2. \"'},\n",

However there are many different beliefs on this subject. Some parents @MONTH1 think it\\'s necessary to control every bit of information a child takes in, while others are more forgiving.     The main conflict with this issue is how different everyone\\'s restrictions are. A lot of parents believe that if any politically incorrect information enters their child, he/she will be corrupted for life, but that is completely false. Nowadays, almost every single person goes through something traumatic, witnesses something illegal, gets involved in drama, experiments sexually, and/or experiments with drugs. The truth is, it\\'s everywhere, and your kids have already experienced it and are used to it. Reading one book with a couple curse words here and there, or an intimate moment isn\\'t going to ruin your child, because chances are, he/she is already doing it all in real life.

If something offended you then u wouldnt want someone else of the same race, religion, or family to read it and be offended. Yes, we have freedom of speech and can say anything we want, but i think it should only go so far and then should be stopped.     Someone can only take so much and then when they reach that point nothing turns out any good. If somebody were to write about the blacks and saying they are all dumb just because they are black, then the blacks would notjust stand around and do nothing. After u call someone names or pick one them so much it scars them for life and it could hurt their whole communication skills for the rest of their life. Not everyone but some even take it so far as hurting themself or others.     So if i seen a book on the bookshelves of the public library that offended me then yes, i would want it to be removed so it doesnt offend anybody else. I dont think that hurting someones feelings is worth messing up their whole life or causing them to hurt themself.     If something hurt u or offended u would u just let it happen or would u use the rights that we are given and try to make it right and not hurt anyone else? Would you want somneone writing about u in a mean way? You would probly try to make it right. If you could fix something and didnt just because you didnt feel like it and it continued to offendother people then not only is it the persons fault that wrote it but i could see it kinda being your fault for letting that person still burt people.\"'},\n",

Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not.  Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life.  This is even taken to the extreme where people want censhorship on libraries to avoid this, which is wrong.     Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries.  They find these things to be offensive.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended.  The world is a public place and everywhere we go, something might be found offensive.  The library is a place for study.  It is never intended to offend someone, or bring bad to the world.  It is simply a place to inform, and if someone is offended by what they see, they should stay away from the library.     I have been to the library many times, none of which have I ever seen anything offensive.  Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research.  There are certain sections in the library.  If a parent does not want their child seeing something, they should keep their child in the children\\'s section.  I can assure you, there is nothing offensive in the children\\'s section, or else the library would not have it in that section.  The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not.  If there was truly offensive materials in the library, those materials would be taken out.     Also, if a person complains, and the materials are removed, it could lessen someone else\\'s chance getting the materials they need.  One person could think the material is offensive, but someone else might want to learn more about it.  If one is offended by a certain material, all they simply must do, is not look at it.  The library can be compared to a big computer.  One can basically find anything there.  Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs.  It is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there.     Everyone is going to be offended some point in their life.  If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone, they would have no materials left.  People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone.  There does not need to be any censorship in libraries.  It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books, music, movies, or whatever else one might go to the library to find.\"'},\n",

But they should\\'nt be removed. I agree that some books are inappropriate and have bad language in them but thats part of the book and how the story was made. When a book is made they way it is and is already published there should\\'nt be any changes made to it.            If a story contains a certain scene that a person believes should\\'nt be in the book, that person needs to put that book back and choose another book they think is appropriate. Some people like to read stories with details so they can picture it in there mind. I know I do. In libraries they have books with inappropriate language and scenes discribed but to a certain age. I think you have to be thirteen or older to read them, and thats a good thing because by that age you know things better and your parents should\\'nt be too worried. So in my opinon I dont think they should be removed from libraries. On the other hand movies that have scenerios that are disturbing should be removed.           Movies are a whole different thing then books. They show the material that is being described and I dont think teens should be watching that. They can be very unappropriate and disturbing to some people like me. I would\\'nt want to watch that in front of my mom or dad and especially a younger sibbling. Then again its just my opinion. If parents are okay with there child or children watching that then it should\\'nt be a problem.           Music is\\'nt that bad. There are a lot of parents who dont want there child or children listening to a sertain type of music because of their religion and what they believe in. I totally agree. My parents at the beggining would\\'nt let me listen to music where all they would do is sing about sex and curse over and over. As I got older they did\\'nt care much because I would\\'nt listen to it as much. Im a teen and I also believe that some of the music now in days in not very appropriate for anyone at any age. Some of what they sing does\\'nt even make much sense. In libraries I think they should only have music that realates in some how to the books.     Magazines are not really a problem. Most of the magazines talk about beauty and fashion tips. They have horoscopes and give advise. A lot of the magazines keep people updated on celeberties and there life style. It has some what gossip. There mostly for older teens and grown ups. For younger teens and kids there\\'s more appropriate magazines where they talk about younger celeberties.      This is my point of view on things. I know that a lot of people dont entirely agree with me but this is what I think. I also know that there @MONTH1 be a lot of people who agree with me and they\\'ll most likely give the same reasons as I did to support their choice\"'},\n",

Like when you go to see a rated @CAPS1 movie and you have to be with an adult to watch that movie.      For little kids I think that they should have things censored because there young. They just dont need to be hearing bad language and anything. Parents should also care about what there child hears or reads if there young. Some parents don\\'t even care what they see or hear and they end up getting in trouble with there teachers if they say it.

Everyone will have very good points on either using, or not using censorship in the library. Although this is true, I believe that there are many more valid reasons not to use censorship in libraries. First of all, how offensive can library material truly be?     I do not believe that is very offensive at all. There will be movies and material specifically designed for a mature an older age group. This is fine; if the person choosing the material is of age then he or she should have no reason not to choose advanced material. A mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life. Sooner or later, they will have to be intruduced into the real life. It would not be beneficial to them or society if they are sheltered their entire lives. Also, if the person is still a child, there should be no reason for a child to choose the older level of material. There @MONTH1 be times when he does; however, this is not a problem because all the parent has to do is explain to him that he is not of age yet. This is an easy fix. As I said earlier, ther is no reason we all need to read the same thing.     Variety is what makes libraries apealing to the customers. Who would want to go to a library with all the same books? I myself would not. Within the library, there are sections specifically just for children. If all the slightly offensive material was to be taken out of libraries, that would eliminate a large portion of the customers. Also, this would discourage writers from even producing thier material; thus hindering their income and motivation. We have freedom and choice in @LOCATION1, and I feel this would go against @CAPS1 values if they were to induce censorhip in a harmless library.      No one is perfect and we all make mistakes. However, we can also improve and learn from them. If a person does choose an inapropriate book, they will most likely learn and improve from their mistake. We have a choice about what to choose when we go into the library. I believe if not all, the majority of the time we make the right choice.     Libraries are a supercenter of learning and information. This would not be true if certain portions of information began to be removed. I have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended. Libraries are here to help and not to hinder our learning. I am most likely not the only one who feels pleased with the way libraries are now and feel no need to change what is good\"'},\n",

The greatest obsticle of them all though was nature itself The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  This idea sounded great at first, but too many things could go wrong.\"'},\n",

The Hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as New York City. Aside from the Fire @CAPS1 the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft so in densely populated areas.

They just need to calm themselves down and just face the facts. Eventually everybody will come in contact with almost everything that is mentioned in books at some point in there life. Life is unpredictable and anything can happen at any moment. You will probably end up reading the books that you are not supposed to anyway when you get older.      The people that think there should be censorship on library books will most likely get there way at least in their community. I think that libraries should be organized in a way that when you walk in you know the section you want to be in. They should have the books for adults in one section, books for teenagers in a different section, and books for kids in another section of the library too. This would help the parents that go with their kids keep them in the right spot. This would also help in a way to find your book if you know what type of book it is.      Another good thing that would help in a library are signs that catergorize the books. So if you walk in the teenager section and you are looking for a good mystery book. You just look at the top of the book case or at the ceiling where the signs are. This would help majorly for people that have never been in a library or don\\'t know how to search for their book in a library.      The next thing would be to have all the movies, magazines, and music in the categories of adult, kids, and teenagers too. They would be in the sections of the books but at the same time be seperated to where the signs in the section say movie and music. This way kids don\\'t have to roam around to find a certain movie that they want and have to roam around in the adult section to find it. The movies and magazines don\\'t have to be exactly in the categories of mystery and things like that because normally movies are more well known than books in our time period.     A good thing that would keep little kids in the right section would be to color it with a lot of bright colors that will attract their attention. If a little kid goes into a section that is dull and boring they @MONTH1 just wander in the adult section and stumble across something that their parents don\\'t want them to. The kids section could be lots of colors, the teenager section could be maybe one color, and the adult section could be the most dull of all of the colors.     All of my ideas would work and keep all of the kids entertained. They also will take more of an interest in reading if they are interested by walking in a library. These are the only ideas that I have that would work well. There could be more things that would keep kids interested but only for a little bit\"'},\n",

After some people read about the @CAPS3 people; They had second thoughts and started get angey and disliking them for theses things and offensive comments made!     Magazines and movies should be taken of the shelves in the catagories in my opinion of the poeple in different countries and the way they live. That could be very sad for someone because they could of really went through everything in that movie or what ever that magzines says. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials. If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldnt you think thats a little offensive? I know I would. There is no way I want my child watching some violet movie.      We have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship is not observed carfully then we could make the foriegners very angry or make our children become very violet and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come in to our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might of thought that was int interesting but turns out to be very offensive in there opinion.

I believe that just because someone finds these things offensive that they shouldn\\'t be removed from the shelf. I believe this because other people @MONTH1 be interested in it, we need information from the resources in the libraries, and all books make people more intelligent.     These resources are in the library for a reason.If what is on the shelves is a distraction to people, they don\\'t have to pay any attention to it. People can find what they like and stay away from what they do not like. For example, there are books that talk about real things that happen to real people in real life and some @MONTH1 not be able to handle the descriptive details that are given; if it\\'s not easy to handle then just put it back and go read something else. Everyone in this world is different and we all like different things.     In addition, some books in the library are used for informational text. College students, teachers, and students from all over the world need a library with these kinds of books, movies, music, and magazines. For example, they @MONTH1 need these rescources to help out with a class or presentation. If they were removed, they wouldn\\'t have any way to find their information because it was found offensive.     Lastly, all books make people more intelligent. Sometimes things are abstruse and these books help explain them better.We learn something new everyday and we learn it from reading out of books. Not only books but magazines and movies help as well. Reading books help people to get stronger with their vocabulary and communication.For example, the people who read more than others are usually the ones who like to be involved in plays and don\\'t have a problem with speaking in front of people. This is due to their intelligent reading levels. They are more likely to remember better than those who do not read and also have a bigger vocabulary.      So as you can see, people like different things and some are going to find these rescources offensive. Also, books are used to help people out and they make people more intelligent. If books, movies, and music were removed then we would not have a better intelligence than we do now. Every human being will have a problem some how and that is just what life is. Life comes with problems and we have to learn to deal with them. In fact, that is what we have to do when these problems come up because we all have a different outlook on everything but books being tooken off the shelves would not help anything; they can only help us out\"'},\n",

Also, the young kids that should not be reading these books should have and adult or guardian with them, therefore they can stop the kid from reading something that is not appropriate.     Something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it.

So why could they not make a section just for books, movies, magazines that people find offinsive. Sure @CAPS3 might take a little bit more work but hey, @CAPS2 one has to do @CAPS3.      As you can see these are really good reason why they should not remove stuff that other people find offinsive  from  libraries.

One of my good friends is a natural blonde and she is probably the smartest blonde I have ever met. Whenever she hears a blonde joke she laughs and say something funny to go with it.    Probably one of the most major things that people get offended by is politics or someones sexuallity. Politics create huge problems for people who don\\'t think something should be one way and then if the governer turns around and says something and someone else will take it way to serious. Many people who have are different because they dont like who they are \\'suppose\\' to like are always offended by someone in some shape or form.

There is a lot of things that are offensive in a library such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect... But if they are so offensive to some people then why keep complaining do somthing about tell it someone. Now librarys are a place where people can relax and grab a @CAPS1 book to read it. When they stumble upon this book that is highly offensve why put it back. Say somehthing and tell the manager this book is too offensive to be in a library.              There are kids in the library maybe looking for something to read they @MONTH1 stumble upon a movie that is very inpropriate. Things like that should not be in a public library. As a @CAPS3.S citizen i belive that things like that should be removed for the shevles. Why would they be up there in the first place what is this world coming to. Some of these books now and days need to be censored. Beacuse of all the @CAPS2 words in there kids might pick up all that foul language.           How about some of this music don\\'t you think some of the lyrics maybe be offensive to some people.

Why not write a letter sstating your concerns.           Things in the librarys like books, movies, magazines, ect.. all should be checked and blacked out. Some of this shoudn\\'t even be displayed in the librarys. There are children in the library now why would you go as far to put things like that in a public library. Lets take a magazine for example, a magazine has things that talk a lot about sex, drugs, and other things related to that. Some people might like it but for a twelve year old boy to pick up somthing like that and  start reading it. To me thats wrong i dont know about anyone else but that shouldn\\'t be displayed in a library.          Now ive been to a library before they have some inapropriate things in there. But i really didn\\'t think anything of it but when i seen a eleven year old boy reading about drugs, sex, and violence that\\'s something he might pick up on. He is seeing it in a book so why not try something in a book. Now and days this world has some shocking things in it but to put things like this in a library is horrible.           This is all where censership comes into play by editing a lot of the things in the library. People now and days dont care but they shoud start caring more. Thats just my opinion why i think its wrong to put all this @CAPS2 stuff in a public liberary. I think this is something kids don\\'t need to see what do you think\"'},\n",

But love is something that develops over time and brings people closer in the long run. Before you\\'ve ever loved someone though, you\\'ve laughed with them. Laughter creates conversation, mends relationships, and brings joy to people. Its an important part of any relationship and has certainly helped me make friends.   In the kindergarten, everything was new to me. I got to leave my house, go to school, eat lunch, and go to recess. There were many children just like me, bouncing with excitement as our daily routine started. Although we played together at school, at home there was no one around to play with.   One day after school, I noticed a boy walking around next to my yard. I walked over and remembered him from that school day in my classroom.  \"\"@CAPS2\"\", was all I said. He turned around, and with all his might, burped as loud as he could. We fell into a fit of laughter and I knew I\\'d made a new friend that day. From then on, him and I were bestfriends. Any adventure that happened after school always ended with us laughing about something. There was no need for our parents to set up any \"\"playdates\"\" or scheduled time to meet other children because it was easier to laugh at something and make a friend naturally, not awkwardly while the parents chatted. From then on, making friends was a piece of cake.Through grade school and well into my teenage years, I had a best friend and a lot more friends, solely, because of a moment of laughter.  Laughing is something that can always \"\"break the ice\"\". Whenever you meet someone new, it\\'s always kind of hard to just talk to them. You don\\'t know whether to be serious, outgoing, funny, or quiet. But if something happens that makes both of you laugh, then it becomes easier to communicate because that laughter eases some of the tension in between. It\\'s like riding a bike, after the initial awkwardness, things just get easier and easier.  For many, laughter helps heal pain. Tragic things happen in every persons life and it can be hard to deal with at times. Whether it\\'s a breakup, a depressive mood, or maybe even a death of a loved one, something funny and a laugh @MONTH1 help them get their mind off of whatever is bothering them. Most of them time that\\'s all a person wants, something to help them forget what ever troubles them, if only for a few minutes. It\\'s how people build better relationships, they do whatever they can for each other to make each other feel better.   Besides it\\'s healing and conversation starting qualities, laughing is simply fun to do. It @MONTH1 start out as a small giggle, turn into a chuckle, and end up as a fifteen minute session of raging, side cramping laughter. And most of the time, you\\'re with friends so they\\'re enjoying the moment of fun and happiness right along with you.   If you\\'ve never laughed once in your life, there\\'s something wrong. It will eliminate awkward moments, relieve painful thoughts or feelings, and create instant fun. Just try it, it\\'s not that hard. I guarantee that it will bring you closer to someone, make life less stressful, and make you happy.\"'},\n",

All these have to stay out of libraries or put in a section where children can\\'t reach them.     Third, parents should monitor their children when they go to public places anyways. The library should be divided into different parts. Music isn\\'t really necessary at a library. They could throw the music out. Also, at the same time children shouldn\\'t get their hands on the books but they would have to learn about that stuff in life eventaully. The committee should have a contest in which people of any age of the community could write an essay telling their opinion also.     Finally, I\\'ve came up with a plan to fix this situation. I personally don\\'t think they should throw these books out because this is how people make a living and some people actually like these things. So they should set up an adult section in the library where you have to be @NUM1 or older to enter and a identification card to prove it. Also, you must have a membership to that department. That way we don\\'t have to worry about censoring these books, etc. Children will not be able to proceed in this section.     In conclusion, libraries are a good source of information. So they shouldn\\'t throw these books, music, magazines and movies out. The library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of certain age. In that way they won\\'t need censorship\"'},\n",

My friends and I are always laughing, to the point where were rolling on the ground, clutching our stomachs laughing. We sometimes laugh over absolutely nothing. I honestly don\\'t know who I\\'d be if I didn\\'t laugh, or what I would become. I remember this one time when my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1, and I were having a off day. We all woke up in bad moods and everything seemed to be going wrong, especially since we were woken up by my mom in the kitchen banging pans and pots around. When we woke up our favorite cereal was gone and so we wanted to go to the donut shop but no one would take us, and even though I realize that\\'s not the end of the world now, it seemed like it then. My brother and sisters, with the @LOCATION1 blasting and running around the house yelling, were irritating us and we were already mad. The dog and cats, who kept trying to keep sneak in the house, were annoying us too. The weather outside was all gloomy and disappointing. We were all ready done with the day before it had even started.  We eventually decided to get up and get ready. We came up with a plan to walk down to river behind my house even in the poor weather. The river was after our big backyard and past the quad track so it was about a mile away. When we asked my mom if we could go down to the river she said no she didn\\'t want us walking down there by ourselves, which we had already done a few times before. We begged until we knew she wasn\\'t going to let us. That put us yet again in a foul mood. We had to go find something new to do and it didn\\'t seem like there was many options.

I spent a ton of time at my grandparents house when I was @CAPS3. Every @DATE1 we got out of @CAPS1 an hour early. And every @DATE1 of elementary school, my grandpa would be waiting for me to get out of school. He would pick me up and then we would go to either @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS2\\'s for lunch. I always wanted to go to @ORGANIZATION1 because they had a play structure. But growing up, I became really close with my grandma and grandpa. My parents didn\\'t need to worry about babysitters because we always had my grandparents that would take care of me. So the bond with them just got stronger and stronger. I would always do my homework with my grandma, and then when I was done I would go out with my grandpa and do yard work or tinker on something in the garage. A lot of what I know now was taught to me by my grandparents. I was a very lucky @CAPS3 @CAPS5 to grow up having them in my life. Doing yard work with my @CAPS6 (which is what I called my grandpa when I was @CAPS3) was actually fun. I loved yard work. He taught me how to use the riding lawn mower at a very young age. So by the time i was @NUM1 years old I could start it up, mow the lawn, empty the grass from the catcher, and put the mower back in the garage when I was done without any help. Well one sunny @DATE2 day, when I finished mowing the lawn my grandpa was sitting on the patio drinking @NUM2, like always. So I grabbed myself one and went and joined him because that is where he always sat and watched me mow the lawn and that\\'s where we always hung out together. We\\'re sitting there just talking, and he asks me if I hooked the hose back up to the fosit. Well of course I didn\\'t because I wanted to go sit on the patio with my @CAPS6. So him and I walked over to the fosit to hook it back up. But for whatever reason he told me to take the nozzle end out to some flowers. Now here is a @NUM1 year old kid standing behind his @CAPS6 with the nozzle end of a hose with @CAPS6 bending over in front of me. So I did what any other @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 would do. I held the nozzle up, aimed right at that big booty of his, and pulled the trigger. After about a good @NUM4 second soaking of his bum, I dropped the nozzle and ran as fast as I could to my grandma. And when I got to her she was wondering why I was so scared. Well all I would say was, \"\"@CAPS6 is gonna kill me!\"\". Here comes @CAPS6 walking up the front door which just happened to be where grandma and I were standing. He had just the most straight angry look on this face. I literally thought that my butt was going to hurt forever after he spanked me. And so there the @NUM5 of us were standing there. Me thinking that I\\'m going to die. And all of the sudden my grandpa gets the biggest smile on his face and both him and my grandma start cracking up. He wasn\\'t mad, he thought it was hilarious! So of course I start laughing too!  @CAPS6 came inside and changed his now water soaked pants and underwear and then all @NUM5 of us went out on the patio and just chilled and talked and drank some great @NUM2. After a couple hours of relaxing with the best grandparents in the world, my grandma went inside to make dinner. So @CAPS6 and I stayed out on the patio and shot pine cones out of the tree with a @CAPS7 gun, seeing who could shoot more down before dinner was ready. Grandma called us in for dinner. And that night was one of the best dinners that I ever had with my grandparents, because all we did was eat, and laugh, and eat, and laugh, and eat a @CAPS3 more, and laugh a @CAPS3 more! Well @CAPS6 and I had a tradition that was started when I was old enough to talk, drink root beer floats and watch @CAPS8\\'s together. And from that night on to the day he died, my best friend was my @CAPS6. He passed away about a year ago. Life hasn\\'t been the same since then. But when he passed he left me his truck. Every morning when I get in and start it up, the sound of the engine just brings back memories of him and I. The sound of the blinker even brings some memories too.  But I know that everyday he looks down on me and thinks back to all of the good times that we had. Ah, how I miss the good times.\"'},\n",

Its not surprising that almost everyone has done just that and they wonder if they could change things, how would they do that, or would they leave it the way it started out, filling their life is complete and they are complete as well, not having any regrets.

I\\'ve learned that no matter how hard you try you can never fully plain your life theirs always going to be something or someone unexpected, all you can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Its not hard to be happy, just keep an open mind and a light heart, and soon you will find yourself laughing with the rest of the world and enjoying your short time on this amazing planet we call @LOCATION1, so listen to your mother and father or even the person you look up to most in life.  There are many things that keep me going, like my boyfriend or my love for animals, but the most important thing i can think of isn\\'t just one thing its a collection of things, such as love, laughter, new beginnings and old endings, a bright and new path (all you have to do is take it) , the relentlessness of the universe, and the idea that there @MONTH1 be other planets out there that sustain life, maybe even intelligent life. Its easy to find things to live for and even easier to find things to die for, hopefully you look for things to live for. I remember when it was hard and I thought I would never ever be happy and I felt like I wasn\\'t right for this world and its many confusing aspects. I was at the end of my path or so I was making it out to be, but then something happened as I sat on the side of an old road. I looked up at the stars and thought what would i miss out on if I ended my path now, what would I dare to name my child or children for that matter if I even have the chance to produce any.Who would I marry if i marry, will our love last or fade like morning due. so I finally decided that there was to much i would not experience if I ended it this soon. after that fateful evening I went about my life slowly molding into a better person who wanted a bright future with a romantically new but burning love story to tell to my child or children, and with devotion, trust,and respect would hopefully last. but that\\'s not all I would want my adventure to consist of. I would want to find peace of mind in a place where silence is a scarcity, I want to help bring out the possibility of sharing the world with animals not pushing them aside or abusing their natural right to be on this @LOCATION1 along side us, I want to solve the pollution problem that we humans have more then helped produce. i suppose in my small way i will because in just one person and a every small thing on this very big home of ours, but as small as I am what i do or say will make an impact. so if I want something to look back and laugh on i had bettered to what i consider my part and making this planet a shared and healthy planet.\"'},\n",

According to the text, \"\"The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.\"\" The wind would make it difficult for the dirigible to get close enough to the mooring mast to get tied up, and even after it is tied up the wind would cause it to keep moving around the mooring mast making it impossible for passengers to exit. Another obstacle in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building is a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the text it states, \"\"This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,\"\".

A library is suppose to be for anyone that enjoys to read a variety of materials, not just a select few because some people don\\'t like the text or the meanings behind that book , song, or movie.     In the library, in our little town, splits up the variations of the reading materials,music,and movies.

Another great thing is that they have books for people in between, like myself, with teen books that spark our interest.

It can also help with relationships to make the other person laugh is always a good thing. @CAPS2 your with your friends laughter can and will always be there, well i know it is with my friends and I. @CAPS2 your in a relationship or a friendship, @CAPS1 able to laugh with that other person is important because it can make you feel more connected to them,@CAPS2 you have a big group of friends that you just met you can all laugh together that\\'s even better because then you know your getting somewhere.  My best friend and I laugh all the time, @CAPS3 can just look at me in a way I only understand and I\\'ll know what @CAPS3 means, and then we both start laughing @CAPS2 we stand in a big group of friends and we start laughing, they all look at us funny. Then normally we tell them what were laughing about, most of the time they don\\'t get it. My best friend and I are always together,besides school, we are always laughing no matter if its something that happened a day ago or a year ago. My best friend and i have a lot of inside jokes,we only have to bring one time of hanging out and if something funny happened we will start laughing about it again. In a relationship as in having a \"\"boyfriend\"\" or \"\"girlfriend\"\" one of the plus sides of things are to make them happy, and laugh, and love to be around you. My boyfriend does it to me, no matter if I\\'m not in a good mood he always tries to put a smile on my face, most of the time it works. @CAPS2 you have a boyfriend or girlfriend you always wanna try and make them happy. That means girls don\\'t get over the stupid little things. Boys don\\'t get mad @CAPS2 they want to hang out with there friends.  The best way to have a relationship with your boyfriend and your best friend is to make sure they don\\'t hate one another, and if they do work it out in a way that you could hang out with your boyfriend one day and your best friend the other. My relationship works out amazing, because my best friend is dating my boyfriends best friend, so we can all hang out if we really wanted to and not fight it\\'s nice to have all of us friends, that way we can go to the coast together and we can go out to dinner as a group. At this time we are thinking about planning a trip to the coast, and going there for a day were not totally sure though.  I think the best way to have a good relationship full of laughter is to make it your all. Just don\\'t give your whole life to your boyfriend or girlfriend cause if you ever break up you won\\'t have any friends, cause they won\\'t want to hang out with you anymore because you left them for your boyfriend at the time. So i always try and tell my boyfriend that with out making it sound the wrong way. Normally the guys understand that you have a life too and it doesn\\'t revolve around them. My friend did that once and @CAPS3 was not happy as all in the relationship,@CAPS3 told me they never laughed together or anything,@CAPS3 was afraid to break up with him though cause @CAPS3 would not have any friends,cause @CAPS3 made him her life.  Laughter can always make you feel better, it\\'d kinda like a healing process it will always be there, its just a matter if someone can make you laugh. Theirs people that can make you laugh and @CAPS4 and videos and family. @CAPS2 your with someone that makes you happy it is like you full of joy and enjoyment to be around them and you care for them and you feel comfortable around them. If you have struggles and get through them and they still make you laugh and happy you will know that they are the one your happy and can laugh around. Family always makes you laugh weather you don\\'t want to or not, i love my dad he always knows how to make me laugh. \"'},\n",

Removing novels and books from libraries publicly or even at school would do nothing more than just raise the childs curiousity level to the highest extent. This, some would believe, would persuade the child to go out and experience it first hand so that they know what it is, and later in life know what to expect. Doing so would, could, and @MONTH1 be harmful and dangerous depending on the act made by the child. When the simplist solution would just be approving that child to read and be educated.     Therefore if one person out of millions dislike a book becuase they feel it can greatly influence one child to do the wrong thing, then another child who try and keep their self away from it can\\'t be taught because someone had a deep abhor for it and decided that it was outlandishly inappropriate for someone, much as a child, to read.          To agree to removing information form the library is absoulutely purposeless, and @MONTH1 be an inconvenience for someone whom @MONTH1 have been determined to research something. With all honesty, books and novels were made for a reason. That reaason is to entertain, inform, and educate. By  removing every source all those who agree to the cause should also agree to the fact that they have no remorse for the outcome of how their child grows up and become someone they never wanted them to be.\"'},\n",

If one person does not like the content of a text, that person could might find themselves saying that they have to right to obstain from being able to view that text in a library, public location, or online source. But what about the other people? Shouldn\\'t they have a say too?     Let\\'s say that \\'person one\\' does not agree with the language in a text, but \\'person two\\', perhaps does. Which person has the benefit in @CAPS1 situation? Freedom of speech and expression are two factors that are very valued, and pherhaps sometimes even overlooked in our society. In @CAPS1 case, both \\'person one\\' and \\'person two\\' are allowed have a right to say and think what they feel about the text.      Should \\'person one\\' still have the right to say that @CAPS1 text does not belong in a public location? Well, if every person had the right to remove something that they disagreed with from the public, there nothing would be left. In such a large and diverse society, there is bound to be at least one person who does not agree with the content of a certain material of each and every lyric, magazing, book, and text that there is avalible.      Some might say that @CAPS1 is unfair to that one group who does not agree with the content of a material. But how is that fair to the other group who actually do agree with that material? Freedom of speech and expression are still not being excluded from that group who does not agree with such material. That group is still allowed to speak their opinions and takes on that particular material, as well as the people who do agree with the material.      Take iTunes for example. If there is a song that has language and/or content that could be considered disrespectful to a person, there is a red tag by the song that says: \\'explecit.\\' @CAPS1 is an indecator that a person who could find foul language offensive, that such person should no buy that song. There is also the compromise. Quite often, if a song is tagged as \\'explecit\\', the is usually an alternative of the same song. That same song is then tagged with a gray tag that states: \\'clean.\\' A song being \\'clean\\' simply means that the song is still the same, but the considered to be disrespectful content is removed, or removed and replaced with different words that are not considered to be disrespectful. Both parties are now satisfied with the so called: happy-median.      Take movies as another example. Movies are rated based on their content. The higher the rating, the more explecit such movie is. Along with the rating, there is an explanation as to why that movie is rated the way that it is. If you are a person who is careful about viewing things that are against your own opinions and beliefs, then by seeing the rating and explanation, such person knows that @CAPS1 material is not for them. Again, the happy-median.     For every given case of a goup of people who do not agree with the terms of a certain content, the alternate group must be considered as well. Both parties in @CAPS1 case are still able to say and express their own opinions. So, should @CAPS1 context be removed from the eye of the public because a certain group of people do not agree with the content in it? No. However, one must keep in mind the views and opinions that each person has on such material, and that person should still be respected for their take on that material\"'},\n",

The architects could not drop a mooring mast on top of the building. A one thousand-foot dirigible held by only a single winch would be to heavy for the buildings frame. In order for it to work it would have to be strengthened to accommodate the one thousand foot dirigibles. This would be a process worth over sixty thousand dollars, just for the framework. Another obstacle was safety. Dirigibles out of the United States contained helium meaning it was highly flammable.

If you find a book offensive it should be put off into a different section that tells you in head of time what books are in that section. I have not had any real experiences with this but I know people are awear of what are in the books before they\\'re put onto the shelf and would therefore not put anything offensive next to a childrens book. Same thing with music and @CAPS1\\'s. Music is music and it is there to be listened too. People like all types of music and have their favorite bands so if they dont like certain bands because they swear or whatever doesn\\'t mean that album deserves to be taken off the shelf. @CAPS1\\'s usually have the rating on the front so if it is not appropriate for your age than dont pick it up. If it has nudity or sexual content it will tell you or be put in a different section. For instance at my old library where I used to live in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 they would put all rated @CAPS2 movies into a different section and if you were going to check it out you would have to be @NUM1 or older or have a parent with you. It is really all up to the person, they could either make the right choice or the wrong choice. It\\'s not the libraries fault if you pick up an offensive book because well, you should have some common sense.          The libraries shouldnt have to take offensive things off the shelfs because some people lack common sense or just dont know what they are doing. They could make more of an effort too kind of seperate bad from good, wrong from right, and even appropriate to non appropriate. But it is usually all up to the person making that decesion.                                                             - @PERSON1\"'},\n",

We also had lunch together, but anyway as I was saying, I swear we had a not stop @CAPS9 war everyday. My @CAPS5 is more like a cackle mixed with giggling. Some people like, some thinks its cute, others think I @CAPS5 funny( The weird kind of funny). In @ORGANIZATION2 she\\'d stand next to me and she\\'d look at me weird, or said something that didn\\'t come out right, or sang obnoxiously, anything she did cracked me up it was so distracted when she was around but so much fun. I swear I got all of my exercise from @CAPS9 with her. At home when my family is all together, are way of laughter is mostly picking on one another. It\\'s different than laughter with your friends. We make fun of how my sister @CAPS6 was supposed to be a boy because everybody thought she was going to be a boy when she was in our mothers stomach. We made fun of my brother for being the only boy out of five kids. We make fun of my sister @PERSON2 for being the shortest one in our family. I can feel the difference between laughter. It\\'s mostly criticism really.I @CAPS5 mostly because I feel more alive it gives me something to live for everyday in stead of \"\"@CAPS7 great, another day to try to get through, @CAPS8...no.\"\" @CAPS9 for me gets me motivated for the day it\\'s like my drug to get through life. It gives me an easy way in to communicate with others. I thank @CAPS10 for giving us the ability to @CAPS5 because without it I would lose my mind and have a hard time making friends. \"\"That\\'s how I make friends I @CAPS5.\"\"  \"'},\n",

This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly� If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, � I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph� This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting.

They hit the ball and it started to come toward me and I went running for it and slipped and fell right on my butt. Everyone including me started laugh because I fell in the mud and got all dirty. About ten minutes later we all were standing there and talking about how funny it was when I fell and how it made everyone\\'s day. Then I saw some mud on the ground and I wanted to roll in it but didn\\'t want to just lay down and start rolling in mud. So I asked my friend @PERSON1 to push me into the mud so I could fall in and roll in it. After she pushed me into the mud I got up and started laughing my head off. My knees were covered in mud and so was my butt and legs. They all started to say who shied on you because we are not aloud to curse, so we made something else to replace it. Now when I walk in the hall ways and see someone from the softball team we both just start laughing and say who shied on you in the middle of what ever we are doing right then.  This is the first year I have ever played a sport in high school and I am glad I did it because I am having so much fun. When it ends in a few months I am going to be really upset.

We have had lots of laughs and many more to come this season. Like when we have games on the buses or just even at practice. We have an amazing couch that makes us laugh and makes jokes everyday.

These issues were the building\\'s pre-existing frame, fire safety, and nature itself. The plans for the Empire State Building had not intended a mooring mast to be dropped on the roof of the building. As a result, architects had to change their entire plan: \"\"The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,\"\" (par. @NUM1). This was a significant difficulty. Also a concern for foreign dirigibles was that the gas the use made fire safety and issue: \"\"... the owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area,\"\" (par. @NUM2). Getting around the fire hazard would be impossible. Finally, as stated in the article, nature was the mast\\'s greatest obstacle. \"\"Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,\"\" (par. @NUM3). The violent winds kept much from happening with the mast. With the three aforementioned obstacles, the fate of the Empire State Building\\'s mooring mast was grim.

       "  'content_text': '\" \"\"@CAPS1 days are diamonds and @CAPS1 days are stone,\"\" are the famous, melodic words of @LOCATION1. He was absolutely right and the day of @DATE1, was a very stony day. It began when I woke up late, having stayed up until eleven o\\'clock the night before in order to finish my homework. As I hurriedly pulled a sweater over my head, I ran downstairs and out the door, to school. Running under the dreary gray clouds, I suddenly remembered the geometry test that was scheduled for today. By my seventh period geometry class, the sleep deprivation was kicking in and my head was pounding. Of course, this had to be the day that @PERSON1 decided to cheat off my test. As his eyes swept over my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared pointedly at his own paper. I should have simply shifted in my seat so he could not see my test, but I wanted him to get the point. @PERSON2, however, seemed to think I was cheating off of @PERSON1. I took the reprimands silently and went to my locker. After collecting my belongings, I turned to go home. A loud ripping noise caught my attention and I realized, with a groan, that I had just torn my sweater on the corner of my locker. Without acknowledging the stares of my peers, I turned and ran out into the pouring rain. Once I had reached my quiet road, I could not contain myself. With my face turned towards the stony sky, I shouted until I my throat felt like sandpaper. I had never had any sort of emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and alien to me. I hoped that no one would ever see me like that, as I had transformed into a stranger, hurt and lost. Following my explosion, I trudged slowly home and entered the house to find my @NUM1-year-old sister, @PERSON3, begging me for macaroni and cheese. I sighed and put a pot of water on the stove. Maybe it was cruel fate or possibly just stupidity, but either way I ended up with half a pot of steaming water spilled down the front of my body. Granted, it was not very hot, as I had just put it on the stove, but all I could do was sit down on the cold kitchen floor, put my head in my hands, and cry. My sobs sounded like a frog croaking. I looked up suddenly, however, when I felt a small hand tapping my shoulder. \"\"@CAPS2?\"\" @PERSON3 asked tentavely. \"\"@CAPS3 did the dog say to the cat?\"\" I just stared at her with leaking eyes. \"\"@CAPS4 are a cat-astrophe,\"\" she answered herself. A small smile was set on her pink lips as she started giggling. Then I started giggling, too, which led to uncontrollable laughter. It was a ridiculously humorless joke, but the laughter felt like cold water running over the painful burns the day had forced upon me. There we sat, a giggling little girl and a messy, laughing teenager, sitting on their kitchen floor on a very grey day. One little joke, with just one fit of laughter, had transformed my entirely stoney day into a perfect little diamond.\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\"One @MONTH1 subject the censorship of library content in certain places and times, whether fictional or not, to his or her own opinion.  I personally disagree with the concept.  The facts point out that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has instated systems designed to prevent such occurrences.  Certain examples stand in play to explicate my opinion.       Society, at least in my native @LOCATION1 and surely abroad in other democratic countries, dislikes enforced censorship for a few reasons.  First, many countries have a @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and priviledges upheld in the face of the law.  Our founding fathers wrote out one of the documents establishing this trend on the prompting of the general public.  The first ten ammendments to our fine constitution, bundled as the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, resulted.       Some of the included statements ensure the freedom to speak as it publicly pleases us as citizens and the freedom to write, individually and collectively without boundaries.  The removal of these principles so ingrained in our nation\\'s conscience would cause a general uproar.  We as a people instituted our government to preserve our freedoms, and we could prepare ourselves to replace it as implied in the @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 if so required of us to continue doing just that.       Secondly, publications such as the ones mentioned for banning rebuke the enforcement of opinion for its effects on society.  I can mention three books portraying this dystopic outlook on censorship.  \\'@CAPS5 @NUM1,\\' required by state standards for one possible choice of reading assigned to us by my teacher, describes book burning and utmost uniformity between citizens.  \\'@DATE1,\\' by @PERSON2, I know describes a dystopia in which all citizens completely submit their will to and omnipotent \\'@CAPS6 @CAPS7,\\' who utilizes omnicient surveillanceeven though I have not read the composition myself.  \\'@CAPS8 @CAPS7,\\' a recent novel by @PERSON1 whose title employs a pun on the name of @DATE1\\'s prime antagonist, weaves the exciting tale of an older teenager who tries to beat the system of surveillance from under the radar.  All, however, betray a sense of fear in their content, and that fear has transferred directly into local civilization.       In reviewing the aspects of censorship portrayed in its effects, the system itself reveals that the even the intended creation of a utopia and compliance through censorship @MONTH1 result in decline and misery throughout the area within which government or civil officials practice the method.  In any case, a more effective solution must exist today.  To prove the point, let me introduce some content advisory systems currently in place.       Libraries divide themselves into sections for the various age groups, and therefore create an inherent barrier between differing groups of content deemed appropriate only in the face of maturity.  The film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at various times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence dividing content into pieces.  Even the video game industry, into which I plan to inject myself upon exiting college, has a system in place to separate existing media into tiered subcategories designed in a similar way to film ratings.  Different regions utilize different systems, but that of  the @ORGANIZATION3, or the @ORGANIZATION1 for the @ORGANIZATION2, compares relatively well in ranking video games to the rest of the globe.       As explained, censorship already exists in a form accptable to all.  Nobody forces anybody to comply to the recommendations, but hopefully everyone does so on their honor.  Capable parents most definely follow the guidelines which have cropped up over the years.  Only if these methods of moderation were enforced would everyone be upset.  It\\'s up to everyone to prevent a situation like unto the worst-case scenario and useresponsibly the systems available for this purpose\"'},\n",

The mood of happiness is expressed when Narciso is talking about his friends in the community and family.

During those meals that him and his family had, they would often laugh.     Laughing and humor were another specific mood of Narciso\\'s memoir.

Kindness is the third mood set by Narciso. He had a kind tone when talking about his parents, and how generous and loving they were.

If the materials propose things like racism, I would like those items taken off the shelves. Sometimes politics have a say in this. This is my say on this topic.     First off, people have an option of looking at those things on the shelves or on the internet. All of us have our own opinion about what is offensive and what is not offensive. Lots of people have families and kids and they don\\'t want their kids to have to see that kind of stuff. The parents have the knowlegde of where most of the materials in libraries are. Also if the parents want to get books, why not go to a different library and get books. Or go to a store that sells books and is a little more censored. I only have one execption though, if the materials in the book, music, movie, magazine is racist in anyway, I would want that removed from the shelf.     Many people have the choice of wheather or not to go to a place that has offensive materials. Sometimes the local, state or even the federal government have a say in wheather or not this kind of material gets put on the shelves of libraries or on the internet. Who knows, maybe someone likes these kinds of books, music, magazines, movies etc., and they don\\'t want them takin off the the shelves or off the internet.

A lot of things these days are changing and it\\'s not for the better! Television, books, and music are becoming dirty and unenjoyable to people. Please help try and help us stop this! We don\\'t want it getting to our kids, like it has to others!     Some people like these kinds of things with bad actions in them! One thing that catches them is the beat, it just makes them want to start dancing. Another reason why they like it is beacuse their friends like it also! People these days are becoming more of followers than leaders like they should be. When people grow up they usually have an idol whether its a singer, book writer, or actor. When that idol grows older it most likely isnt going to be the same person with the same thoughts it had @DATE1, they change for the worse most of the time! They get caught up in drugs or the fame that it puts them in. When that happens people loose than interste in them unless they think its cool! It all just depends on the person! Some people thrive off of these things!     Libraries are supposed to be for all ages! If a kid finds something that was bad at a library and tells their friends or parents thats just putting down the library and they aren\\'t going to want to go there anymore. This is just hurting the library because it will loose a lot of their buisness. Young kids these days are being expossed to a lot of more things that they should\\'nt be! What little kids already know is sickning! Hearing them say that they have boyfriends and girlfriends, and how they know bad words just at the age of @DATE1! It might have to do with the parents or the friends the kids choose but in my opinion it\\'s right! Kid\\'s are growing up way to fast because of the things that they know!     Movies, music, books, etc. are not like they used to be in the fifty\\'s, even the eighty\\'s, yeah they werent the best, but its gotten a little extreme theses days. The words that they say in songs, the things we see in movies, and the picture we see in magazines are getting out of hand. There should be a section that is blocked off only for eighteen and older that has all the bad things in the music, movies, and, magazine articles/picture. People shoud have id\\'s that they have to have to get into this section! This is going to try and prevent kids from seeing what they are these days when they are at a young age. This might not even work, but its worth a try!      The world is\\'nt a happy place anymore! It\\'s filled with violence, sex, drugs, etc. Some parents don\\'t care about the things that their child does, says, or sees. It all just depends on the family. Whether they believe in @CAPS1 or if they don\\'t is another example of this! It always affects ther actions and thought! People try and do the littlest things, and they try and make a difference in the world. That is what people need to do, not get involved in horrible things. They need to get involved and stay out of these bad things; seeing bad picture, hearing bad words, and watching horrible things in movies. Try to make a difference! dont be a follower because it\\'s not going ti get you anywhere in life! Everything counts!\"'},\n",

Then our teachers read us books to teach us things or to keep us preoccupied. Then, when we get a little older, we are assigned to read books for classes. There is even reading in the workplace, whether it be reciepts or orders or recipes. Readings is something that we cannot get away from. This leads me to say that authors write books for an audience and write the book as best they can to atrract the attention of the audience. I do not believe that books, regardless if one person deems them offensive, should be removed from the shelf that they have been placed on. I think that there are things we can do if we do not want to read that particular book. There are also things parents can do to ensure that the books their children are reading are appropriate and not offensive. Also there are advantages to reading books that @MONTH1 show something different that that person @MONTH1 have experienced before.     First, I feel that books should not be removed from libraries because some people think that they are offensive. Everyone has an opinion and just because one person does not like the book, should not mean that the experience of reading that book should be taken away from someone else. If you find a book to be offensive, you can simply stop reading the book. Just because you do not enjoy it does not mean someone else will not also. That is just apart of humans having their own opinions.     On a different note, I think that childrens\\' books are a little bit different. Parents have the right and responsibility to protect their children. I believe that parents should take a proactive role in monitoring their children. For young children, I think that parents should just read the book first and judge whether or not they think they\\'re child should read it. Then for young adults, I think that parents could try to look up somethings about the book. The internet is a great source for reviews and ratings of books. Therefore, I believe that censorship for childrens\\' books is a responsibilty of the parent.     Lastly, I think books that are different to everyone and can be interpreted differently. When I read a book, think about the scheme, imagine the characters, and react to the events, I come up with my own opinion of the book. My friend, who is also reading the same book, could form a completely different opinon of the book. But we both gained something by reading the book.      In conclusion, I think that books should be censored by parents and that is it. I think that reading books is a very positive thing. So no one should have the right to tell people what they should and should not read. Also, books are things that can be discussed and everyone can make their own opinions about. It is my opinion that every book should have its own place on a shelf.\"'},\n",

We have  freedom of speech and press so why can\\'t those books be in our school libraries? What some parents think are offensive, others might not. Most of the time children disagree with their parents anyways so they are going to read whatever they want to read, or watch what they want, or even listen to what they want.      People are different and we have a right to our own opinions. Some parents would say that those kinds of books should be taken out of the library but that\\'s wrong, if you don\\'t like them then don\\'t read them, or discourage your kids from reading them. It\\'s just a book, it\\'s not like it\\'s actually happening. Books are separated by age too, so a young child will be getting books from the children section so those books are for children and should be appropriate. Teenagers have a section too and they should be mature enough to handle what they read in books.      I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from our libraries because a select few people think their offensive, that takes books away from people who enjoy reading those kinds of books. Then if all kinds of people are saying everything is offensive there will be no more books left on the shelf for people who don\\'t think their offensive.When I am an adult I will tell my children what I expect from them and let them make their own choices because no matter what they will anyways and if they want to read a book with bad language in it, or a movie with language then so be it. It\\'s not like they\\'re actually doing what\\'s going on in the book. Overall I think it is completely wrong for books to be removed from libraries for people complaining about them being offensive\"'},\n",

There should not be any problem with giving someone a book that has a few bad word, or a few violent scenes for them to read. Some of the books that are banned could relate to someone, and touch them. Banning books in libraries needs to change.          People should have the right to read what they want to read, even if the book or magazine comes from a school library. There are books that are very good that have been banned. \\'@CAPS1 for @PERSON1\\' for example was banned in public schools for some reason. This book is one of my top five favorite books, and i could not check it out of the library because it was banned. This kind of stuff needs to be open to everybody no matter the age.      Censorship in libraries is something that needs to go away for good. Many peoples lives could be changed, touched, moved, etc... due to a book. Many books that have been banned are great books that can have an effect on someones life. People should be able to read what they want to read when and where they want to read it.\"'},\n",

In the long run there are many things we can do to prevent things like this from happening.

So, if there are people who find some books offensive, and are then taken away; there will be a little amount of books for the other students to read.     Even though certain books @MONTH1 offend people, I think the book or magazine should not be removed from the library or shelf. I believe that if someone does not like a certain book, magazine, movie, music, ect., that person should not have the right for that book or any other material to be taken away. They should not be taken away because other people might want to read that book, and secondly, that would leave a lot less books for other people to read and learn information about.\"'},\n",

I agree with katherine paterson if we can take one book off the shelfs we can take all the books of the shelf.      Katherine Paterson says if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that I abhor.  Which  means that if one person takes a book off the shelf then so does everone else then we will have no books to read at libraries. This is why I agree with katherine on this subject books are wrote for us to read not to be sensored just because so stuck up parent doesn\\'t want their kid reading some book that so many other people enjoy.       Magizines that people think are offense then the should put in a differnt area so the kids cant get them. The same with movies so movies are not ment for kids, but that doesn\\'t mean that we have to take them off the shelf! One thing we can do is put the valgur moves that we dont want are children watching behind the counter and have the libraian get them when we watch them.     As far as for the books make a separte part of the library for books that kids shouldn\\'t read, such as romance or horror books, adult books, some action books.  Music is another thing that some parents have a had time with because of the offense lyrics in them, but some poeple like that kind of music so we can\\'t take that away from them because we don\\'t like it. does that seem fair??     Now does some of those books seem a little better now?  Yes we still dont want are kids read valgur books about killing, and romance, and serial killers, but for some people enjoy  reading those novels. This is why i agree with Katherine @PERSON1\"'},\n",

Books, there are meny different gerens in that too just like music so if it has a bad work, or a rude annicdout some people @MONTH1 not like it. Books are good to read. It would be bad if they were all gone. Then it would be hard to learn or teach anything.

Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for \\'corrupting the minds of the children.\\' @CAPS1 what? One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn\\'t like his ideas. This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day. Censorship is not only wrong, its unnecessary. Here\\'s why.     @CAPS1, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways. For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person. Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend. Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn\\'t mean that they were meant to offend. Think about it next to you look at a copy of \\'@CAPS2 @CAPS3\\' by @PERSON1; is it really that offensive to you?     When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because its of some educational value to you. Books like \\'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5\\' provide a huge educational value because they show what @CAPS6 culture was like, but everyday, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in @LOCATION2 because they find it offensive. Ask yourself, is it right? The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness.     There\\'s one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn\\'t solved, its just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problem are that there are people who wanted to read this book @CAPS1 can\\'t because you thought it was offensive. @CAPS1 this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves. @CAPS1 you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve? Nothing. Even if someone doesn\\'t unban it, people can still teach and tell of what its about, making the ban worthless.     I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this. Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone. It affects a teacher\\'s ability to teach, and a student\\'s ability to learn. Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material? Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve? Either way, you still must know that bannig these things in wrong.\"'},\n",

Has as much the same right as I did. The person has the right to watch or read what I have. To like or hate what ever is on the shelves.     There are lots of things in a @CAPS5. Other than things that people @MONTH1 find offensive. There are scary books like \\'@CAPS1 @CAPS2.\\' @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON2. There are mistury books like \\'The @ORGANIZATION1.\\' @CAPS3 another @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON1.     So to some up my esay. Nothing sould be taken off @CAPS5 shelves.

The word offensive is a contreversial word. Is it kissing that makes books and media offensive or is it curse words or fighting. Many people see many different things.      Many off the books today\\'s youth read are \\'offensive\\' to older generations. That is because today\\'s standerds are different. Children are more free to do what they want and say what they want, making offensive a changed word.     If a book, song, or video is offensive then the parents should take that up with their children. Things that are offensive for some people are just fine for other people. Just because it is out there does not mean that we have to see it.      So in conclusion I do not think that books and media should be removed from the shelf for being offensive, because offensive is a changing word and it is different for every person.\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\" We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter can show emotions, but can also go to the distance of strengthening a friendship, or relationship. To many people laughter is a very important part of any relationship.  First, Laughter is very important in a friendship. If you cant have a fun happy friendship then you wont have a good friendship. Building up to a friendship is always sometimes difficult. It can take up to a good laugh, to not laughing at all to determine your friendship. Having a friendship with someone is one of the best feelings. Knowing that you have someone you can trust, talk to, be there for you, and the most important laugh with is a great feeling.  Also, laughter is important in every childhood memories. Thinking back to when i was little i was always laughing. Even though my mom and dad left me and my brothers i always had my grandparents, brothers, cousins, even aunt and uncles to keep my busy and always have a good time. I think laughter is an important thing being a child because its healthy, you can learn to keep others spirits high and keep others laughing and happy, . and its always good to have a strong, fun, happy relationship with your family.  Last, laughter is very important in a relationship. I think it will build character to your relationship and shows everyone that your happy with the person that your with. Laughter will also build a good and strong healthy relationship and will lead to good things. If you think about it laughter is probably the most important in a relationship because when you decide to marry the person your with it will lead to not getting a divorce and fighting and you will have a strong relationship.  So, therefore after pointing out that laughter is important no matter what age, what gender, friendship, childhood, or relationship you should see that my point is that laughter is important no matter the situation. It helps build a strong person and also builds character to yourself.\"'},\n",

When I was finished, I got dressed in my @CAPS1-shirt and jeans, which is what I normally wear, then unplugged my cell phone from the charger and placed it in my pocket.

My mind quickly recovered from @CAPS2 slightly startled state and I stepped onto the bus.

We stopped at one of the bus stops, and on the bus came my good friend @PERSON1.

We didn\\'@CAPS1 stop laughing until we got to the school,and my joke was successfully forgotten.  The joke lingered in my head all day long, to @CAPS2 day I still think it is one of the best I\\'ve ever heard.

But yes some of them can be more grafic than others, but that doesnt mean you have to take them off the self. Ya not everyone is into a sexual book but there are some people out there that like to read about that stuff. But some people like to read about murders an gangs selling drugs and thats fine. Its like this everyone has their own taste on what they like. it can be a novel, @ORGANIZATION1. Sports, @CAPS1,  just a true story that has happen to someone, an etc. thats just the part of the world. how would it be if everyone liked the same things. pretty boring right yeah deffentally.  So therefore i dont think books should be takin off the shelfs. it could be the next best story for somebody. you never know.     Now with music yes your so called rap today is music that your kids should not listen to. All they talks about is sex, drugs, achole, an etc. But that desnt give you the right to take them off the shelf thats what some people like to listen too. but there is some music out there that dont just talk about that. there is the oldies, country, jazz, hip hop, an etc. but for the most part all music is good its just some of them are better than others, lets take country for instents ya it talks about some sex, an some achole but thats not the whole song they manly talk about country boys an the things they do or have happened to them over time, an they are pretty much right. So all music is good, but without music i dont think the world would be a very nice place. people listen to music all the time. when working out, at work, driving, or just siting at home. So there are some good music an bad muic you make the call.     But with movies there are some movies made just for that reason its all call intertainment for adults. which yes is kinda pointless, but its there an prolly wont ever leave. there are movies made for sex, drugs, an achole. thats just the part of life, everything is not perfect. So in that matter you gota tell your children about this stuff in stop them from watching it at a younge age. because i think it is taking a big role in teen pregnecy, beacuse it they see it an hey it looks fun we shoud try it, and sexual content is so easy to get. its all over the web an etc. its like drugs they are so easy to get. there are meth labs all over for meth. an there is weed all arund. you just gota tell your kids what they can watch an cant. Disney, @ORGANIZATION2, an @CAPS2. are all great shows for kids. so parents be the boss about that stuff.     Now we get to Magazines. there are millions of magazines all aound the world, they are one thing that will never leave this world. they carry news, intertainment, comics, or tips on how to do somethng. thats what is going to be in this world till the world ends. But yes take with caution there are some magazines out there that your children should never look at till adults. but that doesent make them bad people injoy looking at them kinda magazines thats just what people like. its not like your going to stop your son from looking at a @CAPS3. or your daughter from looking at porn. its all apart of life. but you can stop it from happening at a younge age. you just gota get it clear to your child to not look at this stuff till your older. but you cant stop everything. But all i am trying to say is yes there is some bad things out there an their is alot of good things to. but that doesnt give you the right to remove them\"'},\n",

I am also afraid to tell you that i have seen a censorship problem with our public libraries. I can understand why they might censor some of the more mature/graphic novels because of the children going in and out of the library all day, but, i do not believe that everyone else shouldnt be able to get the books they want because of content issues.One reason why i think there shouldnt be censorship in libraries is because some people need to find information on certain topics and there might not be any reliable information on it on the internet.if students in highschool or college dont have the information they need to write a paper or do a project for their classes then their grade could drop and also they could fall behind in work becauase theyre trying to catch up to where everybody else in their class are working.Another reason I think censorship in our libraries is because some of the things they censor could be the only copy of the book or the only one thats close to where you live. If they censor the one book that you need then that could possibly ruin the whole book for them. I believe that if a person is over the age of @NUM1, they should be able to take out any book they want and have it be uncensored. some people @MONTH1 take offense to some things written in these books, but if they dont like something, they shouldnt check it out in the first place.There are plenty of people around this world that have interest in millions apon millions of different topics. Also, some people @MONTH1 not be able to reasearch or explore their topics as much as they would like to because of the censorship problem in public libraries.if people could learn more about their interests they could go on to bigger and better things or maybe even just get a little bit smarter.In conclusion, I believe that censorship in libraries should be banned because of the problems it can cause and the effect it has on people. Censorship is a problem that needs to be dealt with as quickly and effecintly as possible.\"'},\n",

At times like this I use my gift, the gift of laughter. My best friend, @PERSON1 looked at me with her big blue eyes, they were swelled up with tears. We had just finished packing the rest of her clothes and we knew it was time to say goodbye. It hurt me deeply to see her go after five years of friendship but, we had postponed this moment long enough. There the boxes sat waiting, each with their own label, they had all of our memories inside. We were never very serious, we liked to joke a lot and she always knew how to make me smile, today that would be hard though. After we put @PERSON1\\'s stuff in the moving van I noticed her dog, @PERSON2 wasn\\'t outside like he normally is. When I went inside I found out he hadn\\'t been hiding in there either. This was strange because @PERSON2 was the type of dog that liked to have a lot of attention so he was always near you. When I told @PERSON1 that @PERSON2 was missing, we went to look for him.    It was @DATE1 time, my favorite time of year and the sun felt warm against my skin. I remember this moment very clearly, it was a memory I was sure I would want to savor. As we walked along @PERSON1 and I talked about all sorts of things, this made me almost forget she was going to have to leave in a few hours. Just then I noticed a shinny silver object laying in the ground, from where I was standing I couldn\\'t quite read what the engrave stated but I could see the one letter that said it all, the letter @CAPS1. It was @PERSON2\\'s red and blue collar, I reached down and picked it up I figured he must be somewhere near. Fate must have been with us that day because as soon as we glanced up the road we saw @PERSON2 riding in the back of someones old @ORGANIZATION1 truck. We started running after that truck as fast as we could and we were screaming, \"\"@CAPS2! Finally the truck stopped in front of our local store, the guy stepped out and he seemed aggravated with us.\"\"That\\'s my dog.\"\" @PERSON1 stated, and I just shook my head in agreement. The strange man looked at us in wonderment and then looked at @LOCATION1. His face turned red in embarrassment as he too realized the dog in the back did not belong to him. This whole situation was funny and all we could do was laugh. With @PERSON2 beside us we started walking home, taking our time, dreading what would take place when we arrived back at @LOCATION2\\'s house. That night I stayed up thinking about @PERSON1 and @LOCATION1, I was great full to that dog for running off so we could spend more time together. Also I was thinking that maybe he had a reason for leaving, maybe he knew that we weren\\'t ready to say goodbye and we had to have one last adventure, one last laugh.

For many reasons but to save sometime here are just a few of the reasons why I believe this, there would be no books left for anyone to read, if certain books where taken off the shelf we would not have the knowledge from them, and our kids would not know what other people can think of. At the end of this essay one might understand the advandages and disadvantages to censorship in libraries. @CAPS6 many books would be gone?     If we all took off one book that we found offensive then our children and other children would not be able to read. Taking off one offensive book per person leaves no books left in a library. What one person @MONTH1 find offensive another person could find rather enjoyable. Some of my friends think that \\'@CAPS1\\' is an offensive novel but I found the book to be rather enjoyable. On the other hand we also have to understand that there are somethings that just shouldn\\'t be put out in public. @CAPS6 would we get as much knowledge as we have?     Without all the books that are in our libraries @CAPS6 would people get the knowledge to make great discoveries in science, history, and electronics? People would be lost if we didn\\'t have our books. The books give people great knowledge and a great place to learn @CAPS6 to do things. I myself have learned @CAPS6 to become a successful @CAPS2 novel @CAPS3 from the @CAPS4 I took out of \\'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3\\'s @CAPS4 for @CAPS5.\\' @CAPS6 would the ideas of other people be heard around the world without books in our libraries?     Those books that are offensive can also be of great use when doing a research paper or just trying to find something to talk about with friends at school or work. Without the books that we have in the library people would not be able to understand what other people thought about certain ideas on politics and other issues in daily life. The books help people come up with ideas to create things and be createative in everything they do. The ideas that one person expresses in their writing is a great place to find a spark of imagination when a person needs something to keep their mind off of personal issues. Life without books?     Censorship is a good and bad thing in libraries, I myself on one hand do not find it appropraite but on the other hand it can be taken to a whole different perspective. People who want to use it don\\'t understand that other people could take the books off the shelf that they, themselves like to read in their spare time, nor do they understand all the knowledge that we gain from books even if they are fiction, and lastly without the books that we have no one would know what someone in a different park of the world was thinking. Foremost people who want cenorship in libraries don\\'t understand what would happen if we had the power to all take one book off the shelf. One could understand both sides of the coin here but we need to step back and think about what life would be like without our books.\"'},\n",

One of the obstacles they faced was the fact that there was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were thought to be able to anchor on the mooring mast for refueling or service, however, another obstacle was in the way; nature. That was the greatest obstacle. The wind at the top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents. The builders were afraid that the back of the ship would \"\"swivel around and around the mooring mast\"\" With that said, they came to a conclusion that they would be \"\"dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical or safe. In order for it to be safe, they came to another obstacle. The entire building would have to be modified and strengthened with over @NUM1 dollars worth of investment. Lastly, there already stood a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. With all obstacles faced, it was never opened to the public.\"'},\n",

Eventually everyone is going to be exposed to the type of material in some of these books and etc. This material should be allowed in public libraries and highschool libraries, but of course you wouldn\\' want to see a highschool level of maturity in an elementary library.      Highschool students are more than likely to be exposed to inapropriate music and magazines than younger children. If they would like to listen to music that has inapropriate language then they should be allowed to. If there are young kids doing this it is obviously a bad thing because it is teaching them wrong things early in there life. It is even best if they arn\\'t exposed to this at all.       There are also certian books in this world that are inapropriate to even highschool students and they need to stay out of all libraries so that there is no exposure.

Every year more people become impatient. @CAPS1 want people to �hurry� or �move faster.� @CAPS1 need to gain patience by taking deep breaths or calming down. I think the world would be more peaceful if everybody had patience there would be no more conflict and if that happened some day, everybodies lives would be perfect.\"'},\n",

It is the classic argument between two parties trying to prove eachother wrong, what is admissable and what is not. We should try with all our efforts to keep inapporpriate books off of our shelves and out of the hands of the young population.     People can be influenced to do just about anything. There are too many of these tales to pick out even one. The interesting thing is people can be affected by someone indirectly. Whether it be through television, music, or books, man can be molded into something through what they are conditioned to believe.      The influences one encounters can be either positive or negative. As a lowly person who only wants what is best for society, I know that movies with criminal acts or explicit images do not help anyone become a better citizen. It is no different with books. Books that have politically incorrect messages are in no sense better than movies that achieve the same goal.     I am not in any way against reading books, rather I am quite on the contrary. Reading is overall good for mental and social health because it allows us to explore things deep inside of us that are often rendered useless in our fast-paced world. But if one is constantly overexposed to books that are against our very human nature, they should be removed for the good of the people around us. If one cannot find a book to read that is not deemed appropriate, then he or she needs to take a look at themselves. There are millions of books that are not only exciting and stimulating but also can have a positive influence on one as well.     We as members of the @ORGANIZATION1 are already in enough trouble as it is with all our financial troubles and what not. We do not need to add more to the table when we let the population gain access to obsene books that would typically make someone only rebellious to society. If something is making the people of our lands more riotous than it should immediately be censored or removed from society in general. Believe it or not, there are ways to have fun and get a good message across at the same time!\"'},\n",

When we got back to my aunt\\'s house none of us were tired so we decided to watch a late night program called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was a program composed of a bunch of short cartoons. They were all very funny. We would make fun of them and laugh and mimic what the characters did.  We stopped watching it at about @NUM2 in the @TIME1, I was very tired but my cousins were not. For awhile we just sat on the couches and talked, continuing to make jokes and say stupid things that would make us laugh. About a hour later we all fell asleep and continued to watch movies and just hang out for the two weeks while I was staying there. It was probably the best time of that @DATE1. I was very happy and enjoyed my @DATE1 because of my two cousins and the time we spend together. I laughed so much that my stomach would hurt all the time, but I didn\\'t care because I was happy.

Religion is always a hot point when it comes to censorship, but is that not in our constitution. Freedom of religion includes how we interpret and study our religions. Most have holy books and writings. Many express their religion by means of music and culture. It is a right for the public to be able to access this material.     There are some rare situations when restrictions @MONTH1 need to be upheld but merely based on age. This however doesn\\'t restrict the public, but offers parents the right to censor what information their children are able to get ahold of. An age limit on specific types of material could be added in the cases of sexual content, vulgar images, or distrubing content unsuitable for children. This way information is never censored completely.     It is never right to tell people what they can or can not know. It is a part of the very structure of our country to allow all information to be shared freely. Censorhip of these materials is not and never will be the answer. Although, age restrictions @MONTH1 be an answer for younger citizens these materials aren\\'t taken away from the public. Whatever it @MONTH1 be called, book banning or censorship, it is a negative thing and should not be a part of our public library systems.\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\" I met my best friend, @PERSON1, in the third grade. Best friends are the people who come into your lives and stay with you for the rest of it, through the easy moments and the hard times. We learn from our best friends and share experiences with each other. No matter the distance, their friendship is always there for you, even if you are thousands of miles apart or just a few houses away. The laughter between two best friends is an element that bonds them for life, because when two friends truly laugh together, they will always have a small moment in their lives intertwined for as long as they live.  @PERSON1 and I have grown up together. We were there for each other from learning how to jump rope at school through broken bones, school-girl drama, crushes, boyfriends, heartbreaks, weddings and funerals. We helped each other get through everything from hard classes to family pets dying. We offered advice and brought hot chocolate, but this is only the beginning of our friendship. After the problems were solved, we learned how to laugh at our mistakes and move on. Together, we have gotten past slip-ups in what we say, to slipping on the floor. After we have giggled over what the other did or said, we helped them up and moved on. @PERSON1 and I know that, no matter what situation arises, we will always be there for each other, because we have the each others backs. @PERSON1 can make a joke out of any occasion. She is one of those friends that can make you smile just by seeing her face or hearing her voice. Most of the best moments in my life have usually involved @PERSON1 in some way. We have memories from lying in the driveway and watching the stars at night, to cracking up while working backstage for the local drama club. @PERSON1 can always crack me up with her perfect imitations of anyone, no matter how bad of a mood I am in. I crack @PERSON1 up all the time, usually unintentionally, by saying or doing something ridiculous, which shows my true blond side. We laugh over lines from our favorite movies and write down the funniest moments. We have shared so many memories together that we laugh over everything from driving around town and listening to music to being followed by the kiosk workers at the mall. One of the funniest times we ever spent around each other was while we worked backstage during a production by our local theater club. We laughed about everything from building sets to mistakes on stage. We had to open and close curtains in the dark, while wearing full black. I stubbed every single one of my toes that week while rolling the sets on and off stage. My hair was impossible to miss from the audience\\'s point of view, even though I kept cramming it under a black ski hat. @PERSON1 would always have a problem opening one of the curtains that would get stuck when it was halfway open. She had to frantically tug on the rope even thought it kept getting caught in the pulley. I would laugh at her mistakes and she would laugh at mine. We both had a lot of fun watching the audience, director, and actors all at the same time. @PERSON1 and I got to stand in the back and watch all of the actors mistakes, giggling silently with each other. Every time one of the actors would make a mistake, we could watch the audience laugh and the director\\'s face, which was usually horrified for a moment. Now whenever we mention any word or line from that play, we both start cracking up and remembering the entire weekend. There were more jokes then could ever be written down, and every time it is brought up, we remember even more funny moments.  When we are near each other, one quick look or a single word muttered under our breath can crack us both up. We can make each other laugh without even explaining what we meant, because we have shared so many experiences that we can read each others minds. Just one key expression or a twinkle in our eyes can crack the other up. Most other people around us probably would not even notice the small crinkle in the corner of our eyes or a slight smile. Those are the best codes ever imagined, because only the person that it is meant for could figure it out. The messages shared through the eyes a best friend can silently bring up subjects never spoken about and make us laugh. This is why true best friends are bonded by laughter, because it keeps them close no matter what comes, and for every moment of sadness, there are two moments of laughter and happiness.\"'},\n",

It could be something someone said about one\\'s relgion, or taking away @CAPS1 of others. Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and articles should be taken off the shelves at stores just because people find it offensive?  I don\\'@CAPS3 believe it should work that way.  @CAPS2 are a variety of different relgions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf everytime found it offensive we would have nothing left to sell.     When it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe. When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it.  The media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to. Even though the kids @MONTH1 not take offense to any of the media, you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children. Many effects on life are put into the media everyday for everyone to see, and some parents @MONTH1 not find it suitable for their children to be hearing about it.  Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today. I believe it is our responsibiltyto protect from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves, and make their own judgements.     Our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in, and in we think is right or wrong. Your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong.  I was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is I @MONTH1 do.  Some people @MONTH1 have an actor or actress as their role model, so whenever they see that certain person on @CAPS3.V., you tend to think that whatever they do is okay for you to do.  Some parents @MONTH1 take offense to a show on the television because they don\\'@CAPS3 believe that is right for their kid to be watching.  While others don\\'@CAPS3 see a problem with it.  So if we cancel that show on @CAPS3.V., you are making one family happy and many others upset. When it comes to the movies, people have their own different ratings for movies, but the state rates them whenever they come out.  Now at movie theaters you must be eighteen to see a @CAPS5 rated movie, or you must have a parent with you because you going by yourself and your parents not knowing get upset those of manys.  With libraries and movie theaters they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section. My parents believe that if @CAPS2 is a law for something it is @CAPS2 for a reason and we are going to obide them.  As with some parents they have their own rules.  Such as some parents think it\\'s okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on.        A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @CAPS6.  I didn\\'@CAPS3 think anything of it and just turned they movie on and we watched it.  It had a few words in it that his parents didn\\'@CAPS3 agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie.  His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age.  He didn\\'@CAPS3 know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote.  His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from and he told her the movie, and she didn\\'@CAPS3 think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble.  I told her it was my fault, I let him watch the movie and didn\\'@CAPS3 think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age.      It just comes to show that, @CAPS2 are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on.  So if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it, we would have nothing left in this world today.  We learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed.  What we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe.  So if @CAPS2 is something out @CAPS2 you don\\'@CAPS3 believe in stay away from it, and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\" My best friend @PERSON2 turned thirteen on a beautiful @DATE1 day. Her family had a boat and, since it the weather was not quite uncomfortably hot but not so cold that it was chilly outside, @PERSON2 decided to have a sleepover birthday party on the deck with some of her closest freinds. I was nervous about meeting her school-going friends since I\\'d always been a homeschooler and wasn\\'t going to know any of the other people there. When I arrived at the boat, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friends @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. I greeted them all and @PERSON2 suggested we go @CAPS2. I was ready to walk down to the beach but @PERSON4 said she wanted to go @CAPS2 right on the docks. @CAPS2 by the boats wasn\\'t allowed and I was certain @PERSON2 would say @CAPS1 immidiately but instead she walked over to the \\'@CAPS1 @CAPS2\\' sign, tore it down, and tossed it in the harbor. Her friends laughed and I laughed too. I\\'d never seen people act this way. But their disregard for rules and customs was contagious. As the day went by I watched the was they talked and behaved. The girls used bad language and spoke harshly. Everything they said was loud and shocking and everything they did was to be wild and challange authority. They acted so free but there was something about their interactions with each other that seemed forced. I wondered if they were truly this way or if they were just pretending. But I understood that to be part of them I had to act like them. It was my first expirience with peer pressure and I didn\\'t know quite what to do. But the girls\\' attutudes were simple, so I adapted and started to behave like them. But it became clear to me that in order for there to be a group there has to be someone who wasn\\'t in the group. That was @PERSON3. @PERSON2\\' parents had made her invite @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 and @PERSON1 knew it. They would sit close together so she didn\\'t quite have room, they would look with disintrest at her without laughing when she tried to make a joke. I became aware that if I hadn\\'t adapeted so quickly to the attitude of the girls, I might have been the one they left out. I also knew that they could still turn on me if I did something wrong. We were sitting on the deck of the boat talking about movies and @PERSON3 was trying to tell the group about one that she\\'d just seen and was now her favorite. @PERSON1 stared blankly at her, refusing to smile. @PERSON4 looked off into space. @PERSON2 rolled her eyes to me. Sudenly, @PERSON1 cut @PERSON3 off and started talking about a scary movie she\\'d just seen. @PERSON3\\'s eyes widened, then she looked down at the ground. Without thinking, I laughed and reached out to her arm, telling her I wanted to hear more about the movie. I\\'ll never forget the way she lit up at that simple kindness. She smiled and began to gush about how amazing it was with renewed enthusuasm. @PERSON1 condinuted her story while watching @PERSON3 and me. @TIME1, when we went to the movie theater and the girls chose to sit in a row that only had room for four, I moved to sit with @PERSON3 in the next row down. We talked about the absurdity of straws for drinks and how we would never, ever wear skinny jeans. It was easy to talk to her. I didn\\'t have to run everything I said through my head to make sure it wouldn\\'t make anyone dislike me. Even @TIME1 when we were back at the boat, I tried to behave in the same way. I\\'d never had to focus on being myself before but I knew if I could do it, @PERSON3 would have someone to talk to. To my surprise, everyone became more natural. Soon we were all joking about what ridiculous things @PERSON2 should wish for with her birthday wish. I suggested a lifetime supply of marshmellows. @PERSON4 suggested the original @CAPS3 of @CAPS4. @PERSON3 suggested to wish that everyone in america would speak with a @CAPS5 accent on @PERSON2\\' birthday from now on. Everyone laughed. I saw that day that kindness if more powerful than crulty. Making someone an enemy or an outsider doesn\\'t make a friendship stronger. Neither does having to worry about saying or doing something that might make your friends reject you. But integrity and kindness can bring people closer.\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\"Hello, my name is @CAPS1 and I think that books, newspapers, and magazines being censored should be done but shouldn\\'t. When I say that I mean that some books dealing with adventure or romance might have parts that need to be censored, but thats how the author made the book. It was meant to catch your attention right off the first sentence of the story.      I believe that sometimes magazines need to be censored because they are promoting bad habits for people all across the @LOCATION1 and other people around the world. Magazines in my opinion should be censored. Now some make it to where there less inaproperate which is somewhat a good thing, but others pretty much just let it slide and figure it will raise the sales by how ever much percent they want it to be considering what they put in the magazine.      I feel that books should stay on the shelf however. Some people feel that the \\'censored\\' parts of the story are really what catches there attention. I myself have never had an expirence in this field because im not one to be a strong reader, but knowing how other people are, I would suggest that we censor some things, but not all.     People write books all the time dealing with something that has happened in their lifetime or something from their imagination. So we can\\'t really help what people think about and what some people write down to be published in a book. For some readers, it is a very interesting story or passage being read from the back cover of the book, while others just want the book gone from there neighborhood library or out of their house. It all really depends on the reader.      If I could, there would be things I would censor, but not in books. It was their idea to put it in the story but some things need to be left unsaid. Some readers appriciate it, while others do not. It is really their choice to read the book and if its not appealing to them they can simply put it back on the shelf and find another close to it. I just feel that some magazines should be censored. Constantly, you see swimsuit models and \\'sexual appeal\\' in magazines everyday when you enter the grocery store or library. I just do not think it is right for little kids to see that when there looking for a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 book or a book about their favorite animal.      Another reason to censor magazines would be because of some religious views on what people see when they look at the magazine. People everyday become @CAPS4 and being right with @CAPS5, so people will take offense to some of the disturbing images in magazines. I myself as a @CAPS6 take offense to some of these magazines, promoting being perfect and having the life sucked out of you as you read each passage.      As I have said, I am to the understanding of the books having what they have in them, because of the authors imagination, but some magazines just need to be thrown off the shelf\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\"Censorship on Libraries.     Do you ever walk into a library, walk up to one of those gigantic, cluttered book shelves and pick up a book that looks promising, and worth reading? Well, what happens if you go to read the summary of this unfathomably great book, and you just feel...alienated, by the style that this book is written? Do you ever want to take that book off the shelf? Well, I do. But,  if everyone takes a book off of a shelf that they are  uncomfortable with, there would be a miniscule amount, if any books to read at all. Books based on @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisence, because it segregates people.     When you go to the various sections of your local library, what section do you start sprinting towards? The adult section has tons of different genres of books, but what do you do when you find one about @CAPS4? If you are a person of a certain faith, and you find a book that is making fun of your faith what do you do then? Nothing, because there is freedom of speech. You @MONTH1 be uncomfortable about that book being sold in countries all over the world, but what if someone feels that same way about your favorite book. This is a topic people have been \\'debating\\' for years.      Suppose you glide on over to an alienated shelf. This very colorful book is just screaming for your attention?  You pick up the book and come to find, it is talking about @CAPS2. That could make anyone feel uncomfortable. I personally do not agree with making fun of poeple in this way. Poeple are made to look different for a purpose, not to humiliate them but so not all of us look the same, and we can be our own person.      What would you do if you picked up a book, where someone is being teased about their looks, and @CAPS3? Sure one joke can make everyone love you, but when one person is not very fond of you, well that speaks a thousand words. Different genres of characteristics include; being bigger or smaller, taller or shorter, having brown, blonde or red hair. Millions of people are critised and teased relentlessly becuase they look just a little bit different. Everyone has been teased once in their life. It is not very funny to the person being teased.      Books based on @CAPS4, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisence, because it segregates people. I have written you this letter to tell you that I do not support some of the books on the market or the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11, but if everyone felt this way there would be no books. So I do not think we should take the books off of the shelves. We just need to embrace the fact that everyone is different, and that is not a joke. Where would the world be today, if we believed the same way we did years ago about these very topics? Do not take the books off the shelf, maybe one day it will signify what the world used to be\"'},\n",

But their are people who do make a big deal about that kinda stuff. Most people who do i personally think are immature.     Censorship in libraries would take away from people some historical readings, because of nude statues and the way they talked. A lot of the old plays were very sexual and many people find them offensive today. Sometimes their is no way of getting around inapropriate materials. Then their are a lot of people who find those subjects very intersting and like to study it. So by taking those books off the shelf those people would not have any way of researching those materials and therefore they would get upset and complain. The music that is out today has a lot of inapropriate words and sayings in them that would be offensive to most people. But the teens and younger adults like that kind of music and enjoy listening to it. Most of the time they aren\\'t listening to the words, but just like the beat of the song. Almost all of the older people hate this music and never wanna hear it and think it should be banned. What they dont realize is that if it was taken out of the library their would be more upset and angry people then happy. Magazines and movies today have a lot of inapropriate advertisements and pictures, but now that is what most people like and want to see.      You cant really take anything out of a library because either way their would be a lot of upset people. Taking all the materials out of the library would most likely take the number of vistors that come to the library go down, because what they are intersted in would not be their anymore so they would have no reason to go anymore. That is what most likely would happen if the books, magazines, movies music, etc., were found offensive and were taking off the shelves\"'},\n",

I was living out in @LOCATION1 and it gets pretty hot in the @DATE1. I lived there a couple summers @CAPS1 I know how hot it gets. This @DATE1 I wanted to get a pool for the fun and to stay cool. But I didn\\'t want a pool that just I could hangout in. I wanted to get a really nice pool for everyone. I already knew that those kind costed a bunch of money but, I wanted to get a big pool @CAPS1 I could have all my friends come over , hangout , swim and play my favorite game mar-co polo.I went to go talk to my dad about my pool idea. He said \"\"that he would love to get a pool for the @DATE1\"\" cause he would come in and swim with me and hangout but, like I was saying @CAPS2 are expensive and @NUM1 exactly what my dad said. I told him that I would pay for half of what ever it costed. My dad finally agreed with me @CAPS1 we go down to walmart and look at there pools. There was some cheap small ones and there was a lot of huge expensive ones but, I was looking for one right in the middle, not to small , and not to much money. I found one for eight hundred that was perfect for what I wanted. I went to go asked my dad if I could get this one. He said \"\"that if I pay for four hundred of it like the original deal that i could get it\"\". Like I told him @NUM1 what I said I was going to do and @NUM1 what i needed to do\"\". We finally came to an agreement that we had to get the money first , @CAPS1 I went back to my house in @LOCATION1 to make a plan to get four hundred dollars, my dad was doing the same, but he has a job @CAPS1 its not that hard for him cause he gets paid. @NUM4 a lot harder on me cause I have no job. @CAPS1 I decided to fix my bike and go looking around for any jobs available. I went door to door to find people that needed any help around there house. I found a couple of people who needed some stuff done and @CAPS2 both agreed to pay me fifty bucks, @CAPS1 out of each I could get a hundred right off the bat.I had to haul a bunch of old tree branches and garbage away. When I was done I put that money in my pool savings for later. I also went to this place called @ORGANIZATION1 and I was good friends with one of the kids that was related to them. I talked to him about him asking them if I could do any work for a little cash. @CAPS2 said that \"\"I could go to every tree and put a pink tag on him and @CAPS2 agreed to give me eighty five bucks. I took there deal but, my bike can\\'t go threw the mud where the trees were planted. My friend said that \"\"I could barrow his little fifty dirt bike and take it to put those tags on the trees\"\". @CAPS1 I borrowed it and got that eighty five bucks. I gave my friend ten cause he let me borrow his dirt bike.I\\'m almost half way to my four hundred. When I was thinking, I got @CAPS1 caught up in buying this pool that I forgot my birthday was coming up tomorrow. I told my dad that I wanted that pool for my birthday and @NUM5 like \"\"yeah I already knew that @CAPS1 I already bought it\"\". I was @CAPS1 happy that I got my pool. Now I have like two hundred bucks to spend and I didn\\'t know what to buy. @CAPS1 I bought a bunch of food and stuff for the pool party. On my birthday I invited a bunch of friends over to my house. We all got in the pool even the parents.We decided to play mar-co polo. Cause I wanted to play. My friend @PERSON1@NUM6 dad who is a huge dude was playing. I said mar-co and he lunged at me. I moved but he kept going, he went straight threw my pools wall and everyone fell out of the pool. i was laughing @CAPS1 hard but I was also upset cause my pool is already broken. Luckily @PERSON1@NUM6 dad is rich, @CAPS1 he bought me another pool. He seen how crushed I was on my birthday and because he knew I wanted that pool. He also bought me a new bike and it was sick. During the @DATE1 I had a blast in my pool and if I wasn\\'t in my pool, I was on my new bike.\"'},\n",

This is the kind of violence children read about all around the @CAPS2. To think all of the innapropriate stuff children see around the @CAPS2 in television, the internet, and even what classmates are talking about isn\\'t enough, well you are wrong. Some of the things you read and hear about in books are totally unacceptable. This is why books, and magazines need to be censored in libraries all around the @CAPS2.     In our community library in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 we have magazines, in which case these magazines are very graphic. Kid\\'s will read these over any learning or interesting book. Many kid\\'s draw disrespectful things in them. As to think that wasn\\'t ignorant enough they also rip them in half and do many other dismantling things to them. One of the reasons why I feel that the @CAPS2 has so much trouble with criminal people is kids feel these days that they are allowed to draw in books and rip them in half even though they aren\\'t their property. Which allowes them to think they can do whatever they want. Kids read about crazy things that aren\\'t necessaarily teaching you anything. Unless that is you want to learn about having a zombi apocalypse and zombies take over the @CAPS2. To have that in a school public library what is that teaching kid\\'s? Absolutely nothing, but to teach them to take them home and show there little brother or sister a cuss word in the book is teaching them bad things. These are all some valid points as to censor or take out some of the leisurely reading books in the libraries, or to possibly censor some of the cussing.     The last point I will be touching on this discussion is the loss of money that some of the schools have due to damaged books and stolen property. Also to mention all of the dirty pictures kid\\'s draw in the magazines and books. Schools lose a great deal of money just to touch that point. They would save a much needed amount of money if they didn\\'t let those books leave the classroom or school library. Kid\\'s wouldn\\'t be able to draw in them or steal them or even damage them and all the money they could save and put it towards something learn fulfilling.     Well behaved children all around the @CAPS2 is what you can look forward to if you censor books and magazines all around the @CAPS2 in libraries. If you dont let them be taken out of the library how could kids possibly damage or steal or even draw in them. By not allowing kid\\'s do do whatever they want and showing some authority lets kid\\'s around the @CAPS2 know they need to show some respect. With all the money libraries and schools save they can put it towards something learn fulfilling.

Next, we looked for another ride. I was trying not to think about the contest. Later, we found a ride to go on. When we got of my mom told me that I won. Happily, I walked back to the place to claim my prize. When I was waiting it was scary, but it was worth it. I was nervous the whole time. I tried not to think of it too. I was very anxious I want to do it again some time. I told you when I was patient. When were you?\"'},\n",

When I laugh I feel happy, so whenever I\\'m sad or mad people can always tell a joke or something to make me giggle and then I\\'m happy again. I love making people laugh. Sometimes when I try and make people laugh I tell a joke but I\\'m not that funny. When I just be myself, people laugh. I guess I can be funny without even trying.  I have amazing friends, I mean absolutely amazing, although we have our rough days I still love them and thank @CAPS1 for them everyday. My friends and I are always cooking up some way to have fun, and every time we find something to do @CAPS2 always turns out to be funny. Even the little things, such as facial expressions, the way we pronounce a word, or even the way we eat our food makes us laugh. @CAPS2\\'s actually pretty ridiculous. When my friends and I try to tell other people about our extremely hilarious adventures, they all just stare at us as we burst into laughter. @CAPS2\\'s possible that people don\\'t think @CAPS2\\'s funny because they weren\\'t there.   This year my family has an exchange student named, @PERSON1. She is from @LOCATION2. She is very shy and quiet. @PERSON1 never seemed like the type to make me laugh, @CAPS5 boy was I wrong. She is possibly the funniest thing to walk the @LOCATION4. I sure think she\\'s funny, anyway. Sometimes she is so oblivious that @CAPS2 is just hard not to laugh at her. I have a best friend named @PERSON2. We have so many fun memories together. She is amazing and funny. She is so short, people call her a midget, she is quick to reply, \"\"I am not a midget! I am @NUM1\\' @NUM2\\'\\', you have to be @NUM1\\' @NUM4\\'\\' to be a midget!\"\" @CAPS2 is so cute when she does this.  I recently moved back from living with my grandparents in @LOCATION1. While I was living there I had been informed (over the phone I might add) that there was a girl living in my old bedroom. \"\"@CAPS2\\'s a foreign exchange student from @LOCATION2,\"\" my family told me. I flew back up to @LOCATION3 for @CAPS4 with my family. When I got here I met @PERSON1. She seemed so quiet and sweet. @CAPS2 was late when we got home so I immediately went to sleep. The next day I woke up, called my grandma, then called @PERSON2 and asked her to come over and hang out with me. She came and met @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told us she wanted to get my mom a birthday gift and I replied, \"\"@CAPS5, that\\'s tomorrow, lets go into town.\"\" All three of us went to town and went to @ORGANIZATION1 For @CAPS6. When we got there we all looked around for something we thought she might like. Somehow, we ended up in the underwear aisle. @PERSON2 picked out a tiny sized pair of underwear and shouted, \"\"@CAPS7 @PERSON1, what about these?\"\" @PERSON1 looked at her with the funniest facial expression and shouted back,\"\"@CAPS8, I don\\'t think my thighs would fit through that!\"\" @PERSON2 and I literally fell onto the floor and laughed so hard that our faces were bright red. Based on our first impression, we thought she was a quiet, \"\"keep to herself\"\" kind of girl so we just thought @CAPS2 was hilarious. We tease @PERSON1 about this quite often and she teases back about other funny things we\\'ve encountered.

There are people who can read, listen, watch, and see what they like. Definately, I really think that it should not be removed even though it doesn\\'t have positive things.     Although, it might offend some people they have a choice whether they should see, watch, listen, and read it. Many people might agree with the author about what she thinks about this. Though, many people might go against it. One reason why I think that people should be allowed to see, watch, listen, and read whatever they would like to see, it\\'s because it\\'s their own choice. We make our own decisions whether people like it or not. Another reason would be because people would want to see the funny things that people invent that actually make the shows. Some people do not like to be bored of the same thing.     Katherine Paterson the Author, is right in some ways. She wouldn\\'t want her children to see things that are inappropriate. I have a daughter and I wouldn\\'t want her to see things that are abhor. Last reason would be children should not allowed to see inappropriate things until they are eighteen or older. These things can influence children very intensely.     Indeed, many people in this world are influenced with bad things. The author stated, \\'then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.\\' Right, she is meaning that we have a choice of what our children would like to see. For example, there is a magazines full of negative words and full of horrid stuff. Would you pull it out of the shelf for your child to not have a chance to see that? You should if you love your child even though it\\'s your own choice. You would want the best for you child to not see, read, watch, and listen to things that are inappropriate.     In conclusion, this would be your choice. There will always be things in the world that you don\\'t like. You cannot stop the terrible things from happening. In the libraries there shouldn\\'t be anything negative anyway because you never know what your child might be doing. Simply, teach your kid what is wrong and right. Finally, from what you experienced. Teach them the right things from the wrong things you learned so they wouldn\\'t do the same mistake as you did.\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\"Censorship or not? That is the question. Many people @MONTH1 not realize it, but what they read and watch greatly affects them. If children watch a scary movie, then nightmares seem to occur more often. If teens read a book where parties seem cool and bad  things are glorified, they too start to see bad as good. What if @CAPS2 article you are reading right now contained offensive language and inappropriate ideas? Most people would be offended and complain. I fyou saw an old man walking down the street yelling out obtrusive things, you would be mad and tell him to quit. So then the question is arised, why is it alright for us to watch movies like @CAPS2? Yes, books and movies should be censored.     Children are very naive at a young age. When a child starts getting exposed to violence, illegal acts, alcohol and drugs in books or movies, they start to think it\\'s okay. For instance, when I was younger, I watched the movie \\'@CAPS1.\\' @CAPS2 movie contains a profanity every other word, so it seems. I saw my favorite actors on @CAPS2 movie saying bad words, so I figured it was alright. It\\'s not okay for a child to talk offensively like that. One day I even heard a little @LOCATION2 quoting lines from the \\'@CAPS3.\\' @CAPS2 movie is hilarious but extremely suggestive. It made me sad to hear an innocent little @LOCATION2 talking about things that are way over his head.      Teenagers that listen to music from @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 are getting bad messages. Although these two rappers are seen as modern day music heroes, they shouldn\\'t be glorified the way they are. They\\'re songs are all about smoking weed and getting high. They make it seem cool. So teenagers think, \\'@CAPS5 if they can do it, so can I!\\' They start to engage in activities that were once frowned upon. If teenagers were\\'t exposed to @CAPS2 kind of music, they wouldn\\'t be as apt to take part in such things.      As for adults, their movies and books should be censored too. One @MONTH1 think that once they\\'re older they can do waht they want, but that\\'s not the case. Let me throw out an example to you. Let\\'s just say a husband and wife are watching a movie together. It\\'s great until a rather, inappropriate ,shall we say, scene comes on. Not only does it make things awkward, but it sends out the wrong message. When adults or unmarried people see their favorite actors being naughty on television, it makes it seem right. They start to lose the concept that you are supposed to remain abstinant until marriage. After all, it is the only way to remain free of any diseases.      If movies, books, magazines, and music continue to be left uncensored, the world will become a giant brouhaha. People will begin to lose the sense of what is right and what is wrong. We are on the brink of violence and total chaos. If we contiue to let our children and ourselves watch these types of movies and whatnot,things will get ugly. Yes, if libraries or stores find anything offensive on their racks, then they need to censor it before it corrupts any more minds\"'},\n",

As we all know, there are things like books, picture, and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see. This is @CAPS1 parents are so carful with computers, and what their children have access to.      Every situation has it\\'s pros and cons, but in @CAPS2 cases if you analize the pros and cons you can come to an accurate conclusion. When you go to a library with your children, the children run off to do what they want, usually to the children\\'s section. Let\\'s face it, children do not want to look at adult book. Once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem. As children get older they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading harder books, and look at want they want on the computer.      I\\'m sure that the first thing that might come to mind is to censor the library, take away the horror films, the banned books excetra. This might be fine at first, but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want. The library is free, does this mean that if our society does not like a book, movie, or magazine taht the adults must go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie as apposed to borrowing if for free at the public library. It could work, but if a child is going to look at bad things at a library what will stop him/her from looking at them at a bookstore?

It makes it seem like the younger generations can not handle it, or that past generations have something to hide. The definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time. Does it just end here and now? @CAPS1 would we take the classics away? Let\\'s face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in the next generations what is stopping them from being forgetten? Some banned books parents will look at and say, \\'@CAPS1 would this be banned? I do not remember anything bad in it.\\' @CAPS2 of the time the classic banned books were written some time in the @DATE1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 or the @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Society was different then. When you read a classic it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written. Usually the book will be banned because of bad language which people thing should be taken out of our schools, but they are missing the point. That was how things were back then so, who are we to hide it?      Does this mean that I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries? Not at all. Some magazines can be avoided, or be put in a section away from younger children\\'s eyes. Horror movies do not have to be taken out completly, just put in a different section. If parents are worried about monetering their children on the internet there is nothing stopping them from watching their children while they are using a computer.      I think that there can be come cesorship in libraries, but sometimes our society goes overboard. As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations we can make our country a safe yet edjucational place to learn\"'},\n",

The librarian says the book was removed from all public libraries because it was found offensive.      Would this not get on your nerves? Especially if you had read the book yourself and found nothing wrong with it? Sure, there are some books that children should not be allowed to see due to offensive material; but why remove them completely? There are plenty of alternet solutions that could please everyone. Such as having a section only adults are allowed into, having a seperate public place for adults to get the books, movies, ect; and having signed permission from a parent or guardian saying their child could check out certain items.      The first solution is to have certain offensive material under lock and key from the public. If only the librarian had access to this material a child could not simply walk in and borrow what he, or she deems fit. The librarian would be the only one allowed to judge if the person, child or adult, could see this section of the librairy.     Next, there could be a totally separate building for the offensive material. Only people over @NUM1 would be let in and you would have to an i.d and a librairy card to get in. This would assure that no one uinderage could recieve or take anything that was deemed unfit.      My last solution is to have signed permission for anyone underage. When the child comes to get a librairy card the parent must be present and fill out an application saying what the child can and cannot check out.      I do not believe that books, movies, music, ect; should be removed from shelves. This directly goes against the first ammendment, free speech. If a person can say what someone else can or cannot read, see, or listen to whats to stop them from taking every @CAPS1 given right we have? Whats to stop them from censoring everything we write and say? Would you want to live in a world like that? I would most certainly not! However, I also believe that certain age groups should not be allowed to have access to certain material.

I personally believe that all of these works have a right to be seen, heard, or read, because the creator has put much effort into stating their opinion and have a right to freedom of the press.         You could take any famous work and someone could be offended @CAPS5 it because it displays something contrary to their beliefs. But this does not mean that that work should be banned!

You simply can\\'t apply censorship because whether you keep it on the shelves or not, people are going to be offended. Also, as shown in @PERSON1\\'s @CAPS4 @NUM2, the censorship of books could lead to a society unable to have a real knowledge of the past and the feelings and thoughts of the people of that age.      To me, \\'offensive\\' books, movies, and music are not bad, they are merely a stimulant for debate. They can allow you, rather than just the author, to express your feelings on what was presented in the works. But to completely remove the cometition of the debate would be sabotage. @PERSON2 @LOCATION1 that \\'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.\\' @CAPS5 saying this she is expressing that if we all could go into a library and remove the books, magazines, movies, or music that we do not like, then there would be absolutely nothing left. Every work would be remove because at least one person is offended @CAPS5 every work of the sort. Therefore, to allow books to be read, music listened to, and movies watched is to allow everyone the freedom of writing down their thoughts or stances.      The censorship of any work, anywhere, is allowing for the \\'shutting up\\' of ideas. These ideas are the ones that keep society going @CAPS5 making us think and helping to formulate our opinions. @CAPS5 allowing this we are creating future generations of great thinkers.

A couple could go in the library trying to find a good healthy funny movie, but could find a movie that would make them uncomfortable.

Are you furious when you finally get a chance to read that book you\\'ve been waiting on for two months and all of a sudden it\\'s not to your avalible because of its content? I know I always amd because at @ORGANIZATION1 this happens quite often. I believe that a book shouldn\\'t be removed because only one person found it to be offense. Sure some novels @MONTH1 expose a few word of profanity or discrimination but everyone has to deal with it. So why take one book off the shelf for saying something vaulger because not everyone might dislike the book. If we took a book off the shelf everytime someone reported a bad word or a discrimitive remark then we would be left with no books including the ones that tell us a great deal about past history.     Some authors, movie directors and artist rely on history to help them create a great piece of reading, comentary, or lyrics. If the libraries in the public and in schools censored everything there could be a @ORGANIZATION1 risk of loosing alot of historic and epic material or information from the past. As im sure you know alot of history books about the holucaust, slavery, and the civil rights movement include words that people of certain genders or races @MONTH1 find offensive. These words are a vital source in the attempt to explain what the people in those situations are going through; therefore those words shouldn\\'t be reported for histories sake.     I know im not alone in my fight to keep books on the shelf because an author named Katherine Paterson says, \\' ... If i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same righ and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us\\' (Paterson). In this quote she is trying to say if people abuse this policy there will be no books left on the shelf for anyone to read becasue someone found something offensive to them. This is what will eventually happening if we don\\'t censor the @CAPS1 in the libraries.     Now don\\'t mistake me for someone who believes that @CAPS1 should be dropped all together becasue I believe it is needed in some cases. If there is a song that use profanity multiple times without any logical reasoning then it shouldn\\'t be availible to the public through a library. Also if there are inappropriate movies I don\\'t think that they should be distributed by the library to the public becasue thats what movies rental stores are for. On the other hand I haven\\'t found a single book that isn\\'t suitable for the library; so why are there so many books being takin away every year due to what some people call \\'@CAPS1\\' also known as  self opinions?     In this writing my goal was accomplished; I wanted to let everyone know that the whole @CAPS1 thing is getting a little out of hand. We all know that there is some offensive things that @MONTH1 be happening but they are things that everyone who views that book, movie, or soundtrack has to deal with. With some offensive things comes a reasoning like in history books and movies that @MONTH1 contain a few bad words but are used to get a point or setting across. I know that @CAPS1 is just another way of looking out for the better of humans but alot of it has a reason. The only case where @CAPS1 should be used is in innapropriate movies and songs with no hisrtoric purpose. With all that has been said, do you still believe in all of the @CAPS1 going on in your nearby library? How can you help prevent the destruction of all of the historic words in libraries?\"'},\n",

Plus when you attempt this you are above crowded New York streets. If there was ever a malfunction or error while docking then thousands of people may lose their lives. Its much easier lending dirigibles in an open field than in mid-air because you have much more room, your planting the dirigible on secure ground, and you can weigh it down so it doesnt move around. Yet landing in open fields is dangerous because on @DATE1 in @LOCATION2, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This example shows how that if that were to happen in mid-air over a crowded New York City street or block then many more casualties would have been recorded.

Sometimes Laughter is good @CAPS9 comes from the heart. Other times it can be cruel @CAPS9 mean. I like to avoid the cruel @CAPS9 mean laughter, @CAPS9 just stick to the good laughter. When one of my friends is laughing @CAPS9 smiling, it makes me want to know @CAPS10 they\\'re laughing about, so I can laugh too.  Birthdays are fun, laughing usually comes with fun. I remember my twelfth @CAPS2, I decided to have a party at my house. I wanted it to be very special so I invited my closest friends, @CAPS9 my cousins. Family always makes everything special. My cousin @CAPS9 I are pretty close, she was born nine months after me, so we are both the same age for a little while. We always have a good time, both of us acting crazy @CAPS9 always laughing. For my party my mom made rainbow sherbert punch, it was delicious. Everyone had fun, @CAPS9 soon the party was over, but, my cousins were not leaving until the next day so we continued the party. I was in the kitchen getting more punch, my cousin came in @CAPS9 wanted some more too. I poured both of us a glass. \"\"@CAPS3 is so good!\"\" my cousin @PERSON1 said. \"\"I know that\\'s why I had my mom make it\"\" \"\" @CAPS4 you wanna hear a joke?\"\" \"\"@CAPS5.\"\" @PERSON1 said. \"\"@CAPS6, @CAPS7 once was a kid named butt itches, he was really sick @CAPS9 one day died, his mom cried to the doctor,\"\"@CAPS8 my poor butt itches!\"\" \"\"@CAPS9 @CAPS12, @CAPS4 you wanna know @CAPS10 the doctor said?\"\" \"\"@CAPS10?\"\" @CAPS11 @PERSON1. \"\"@CAPS12 itch it!\"\" @PERSON1 had just took a drink of punch when I said @CAPS3.

You would think that getting punch spitted at your face, on your @CAPS2, would make you mad. @CAPS3 is why laughter makes ordinary days special.

Lastly, as the except claims the greatest reason for not being successful, the safety violations of the mast were too great. \"\"Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable.

In the adult section they have adult books. Those sections are there to keep children from reading or seeing things that @MONTH1 be what their parents don\\'t want them seeing. But then again, a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended.     Completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing. It takes away certain literature that people might like reading. But then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight. I am a big reader so I have been to librarys many times but I never actually saw any material that was so bad I thought it needed to be taken out. If there was though, they should just make an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people think should be put there.      For example, some albums that contain offensive language or topics have \\'@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3\\' stickers on them. It\\'s simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library. People that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out. Books always have reviews, so people can tell if those are too @CAPS1 or not. The library staff could put those books in the alternative section. Movies always have ratings, so staff could put anything rated @CAPS4 or above on those shelves. Now I\\'ve never seen a bad magazine at a library before. I\\'m sure they would never have magazines such as \\'@CAPS5\\' or \\'@ORGANIZATION1\\' there. People wouldn\\'t need to worry about magazines from my experience.      That is my solution. Make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely. That takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material. You couldn\\'t take away movie classics like \\'@CAPS6\\' or \\'@CAPS7\\'. Those movies have been put on the highest of best film lists. Yes, they are rated @CAPS4 but no, that doesn\\'t take away the fact that they are great movies. Don\\'t take the material out. Just make a new section for it.\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\"When it comes to my idea of having censorship in the libraries around the world I believe that there are cases when there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that should not be on the shelves. Not only are there things in the books, etc. that children might not understand and take the wrong way, but there are also things that adults of any age might take offensivley as well.     In my years of being in school I have encountered many books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that I have thought should never even end up on the shelves of libraries. For one example, I was looking through the library one day for a book that I would be able to do my book report on, and just from reading the back of the book I learned that this book involved drugs, sex, and many other things that I thought would be inappropriate for someone even my age to read. For the librarians and other school workers involved in the buying of books, I am sure that they never even think twice about a book being offered to young children and teenagers that it would be inapropriate or offensive, but in almost all cases every single book has something that would prove them wrong.     Also I have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve. In my own experience from reading the book I would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to. Not only are there books that I have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive but also many magazines, movies, and music. There is usually not alot of music that would involve offensive behavior in libraries but in some cases there are. For example, I new someone that was doing a report on pop culture and while researching the music and listening to the music that the library provided, they found it to be very offensive and inappropriate for himself to hear. Other than that I have found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive.     I myself would think that teenagers above the age of @NUM1 would understand the meaning of being mature. I have observed that most teenagers and even children that read offensive books end up having a behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of. When it comes time for my children to reach this age I would hope that they would never act like some of the kids I have seen or spoken with.     After understanding how much inappropriate/offensive behavior there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I not only recommend that they evaluate the type of books, and other resources that are offered in libraries, but also I have realized that I sure hope they get this matter taken care of right away. I not only feel that parents around the world would feel the same as I do, but I know for a fact that I would never want my children to read books that I have read or been offered through my high school library. This is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers. The world is becomming more and more violent every single day, and it is up to the future children to solve this problem. In a sitaution like this, we do not want the minds of the youth to be infested with offensive and inappropriate behavior. Let this be a step in the right direction\"'},\n",

I @CAPS1 heard a lot about @CAPS6, @CAPS7 friends @CAPS2 always talking about how cute and muscular @CAPS3 is.

When we stop @CAPS3 jumps out of the car and rushes to @CAPS7 door to open it. @CAPS3 is such a gentle men i thought to myself. When we get to our table @CAPS3 orders for us both and asks me all sorts of questions. @CAPS3 kept me smiling the hole time! I don\\'t think any boy has ever done that. After we ate and @CAPS3 drove me home we smiled and laughed as @CAPS3 told me joke after joke. When we reach @CAPS7 house @CAPS3 asks me a question. A question i will never forget. \"\"@CAPS11 i kiss you?\"\" @CAPS3 asks. I do not answer but lean in and kiss him. We look into each others eyes after wards and begin to laugh.. Why we laughed i still will never know. But at that moment i fell in love. At that moment i realized laughter will be the connection between us forever.

Then @CAPS1 ran to me and said I should go take a look at the book he was looking at, so I went with him to go see the book.

Some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings, while others, over the same topic, believe the complete opposite. They believe that the words of the artists and authors shows feelings and have messages hidden within words of vulgarity, which is where i stand on the situation.     @CAPS2 seems as though everytime we cross over this bridge, @CAPS2 comes right back in front of us. Many of those opposed to the freedom of writing and music are usually the ones that feel as if they must preform proper edicate and have everyone act nothing less of the same, unfortunately for many, the people that are like this, usually, have much power in the say of what comes and what goes, not allowing many of us lower graded people in society to get a chance to veto their poor outlook on things.      My opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too. However, I still believe that much of what is considered \\'censored\\' material should not be censored at all. There is one, count that, one situation where I feel censorship is necessary. One is songs that go on for @NUM1 and a half minutes saying nothing but \\'*bleep* this, and *bleep that\\'.      All other material, whether @CAPS2 be @CAPS4 rapping or @PERSON1 writing, is acceptable. There\\'s just many people in the world who need to grow up and listen to the lyrics/words, to get the full message before automatically assuming that there is a problem with @CAPS2. Great @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, he always has a message in his music, whether @CAPS2 be about family or just life in general, however many words he uses are considered unfit for our time, so you just hear \\'*bleep*\\' when @CAPS2 is on the radio.

In the essay, it says, �I arrived at the first �Town��this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time�but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, �short, rolling hills� (@NUM2) in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldn�t have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination.

       "  'content_text': '\"Why is censorship important in libraries? Why should we care if there is censorship at all? I am here to tell you today my views and opinions on cenership at the library.     When you walk into a library I assume you would expect a public area where you can read books and check them out, but what happends when you browse through these books and you find something offensive? How do you act, and what should you do? In my opinion censorship is alright but only used when needed. Censorship protects childeren and young adults from viewing things that are adult eyes only such as horror books, offensive music, and in most cases pornography. Censorship in the library is an important role because anyone can go into a library and pick up any book, but when you have and adults only section for books, movies, music etc. it stops alot of people to having to worry about there kids seeing bad things. For instance, if tweleve year old @PERSON1 goes into a library and finds a video game with large amounts of violence in it he can check it out and play the game without his parents knowledge of the incident. With censorship we eliminate such problems.     Now like I stated before censorship is ok when needed, because censorship can get carried away as well. In reality, its the parents fault of why there kids do things also like letting there kids listen to music with heavy swearing or full access to a personal computer. Things like that are creating problems for parents as well as people around them. When I say censorship is ok when needed I mean people censor important information on the account of a event that has happend in the past. Another example, if your in ninth grade and you enter a library for a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movie but its to graphic the student is stranded for a source and must gain access to a computer.     Now that you have my opinions and beleifs you can get a better understanding of what I mean. Censorship is a good thing but it can also be a bad one as well. I think that if censorship is controlled correctly it can become a powerful tool in any library, school, and even home. Censorship is at times out of control but maintained we can use it for many things and have a great community as well as country.     In essence, Censorship is ok to and extent and you should beleive this as well just because if you think long enough you too can see what I see.\"'},\n",

One topic that seems to get everyone going is censorship. Everyone has an opinion on it; and not everyone agrees with eachother.     All libraries have different sections based upon age. There are childrens sections, teens sections, and adult sections. I think censorship has a lot to do with maturity levels. Things in books and movies that aren\\'t appropriate for children, shouldn\\'t be put in the children section. I understand parents\\' don\\'t want their children reading or watching abscene material; but as kids are growing up, they\\'re going to learn about the innapropriate things sooner or later in school.      I don\\'t think anything should be taken off of a shelf just because a handful of parents find the material offensive. I don\\'t take censorship very seriously. Some parents want their children reading books with innapropriate material so they can learn about what goes on in the world and what life is like. Most children and some teens don\\'t know what the world is like because they don\\'t get out much. They don\\'t learn things that they should know already. Reading is a way of learning. When someone wants to know more information about any place or anything, they go to the library and check out a book. For a school project or just for fun.      Most parents agree that nothing innappropriate should be in a childrens\\' section at a library. Just because they\\'re young and parents don\\'t want their kids going around at the age of @NUM1 cussing like a sailor. But I think that teens are mature enough to read or watch innappropriate material like a book with cussing or a movie with kissing scenes. Parents shouldn\\'t have a say on what goes on or off the shelves in a library. They should just mind their own business. If their kid picks out a book that they think is too offensive for them to read, then they can just simply tell them that they cannot get the book. It\\'s as simple as that. Parents who ask for books to get taken off the shelf are just asking for too much.      Censorship in libraries is not a big deal to me. I think kids should be able to read a book that they want to read. At least they\\'re wanting to read. Let them read for @PERSON1\\'s sake. But like I said, everyone has their own opinions.\"'},\n",

The first and most obvious obstacle was the danger of crashing. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders realized how much worse the horrific crash would have been in downtown New York. Another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower. As said in paragraph @NUM1 \"\"The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.\"\" That coupled with the lightweight nature of dirigibles would make mooring much more difficult than on an open field. The last obstacle faced by builders was the existing laws that made it illegal.

If you\\'re down, one smile, or laugh, causes your body to send messages throughout you body making you feel better. Scientists also say that it takes more muscles to frown than smile. I believe that this is true, because in order to frown, you have to make your whole body look like it\\'s frowning, like your shoulders and your face, but only a little smile shows people that you\\'re happy. In that way, my family is extremely beneficial to each other. Everyday when we\\'re having a conversation, someone will bring up a story, or movie quote that they were reminded of and say it out loud to everybody with just the right accent so that it sounds exactly like the movie, and cause everyone to laugh. For example, every now and again, my brother or sister will bring up a quote from @PERSON1 or @PERSON2, two comedians we really enjoy listening to, and every person in the room would pitch in with hilarious quotes they said and this could go on all night. Or, a little while ago, my favorite movie wasGet @CAPS1 because it was quite entertaining, so we would have rampages over supper or just randomly in the kitchen quoting that one movie for at least half an hour and the room would be filled with non-stop laughter. On the other hand, someone will make a random comment because they heard wrong, or just don\\'t understand. Like when we were having a dinner party at my house. My family and our guests were sitting at the table just finished eating when we got onto the topic of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because my little sister was learning about them in school. We verbally completed the train of \"\"Which @CAPS4 ruled @CAPS5, who they came from, and @CAPS5 they\\'re other names were\"\". But according to my little sister, we missed one. So, out of the blue comes \"\"@CAPS5 about @CAPS6?!\"\". Her intentions were about the @CAPS4, but I believe everyone in the room heard \"\"@CAPS5 about @CAPS9 @CAPS10?!\"\", until we paused for a second and processed @CAPS5 she meant, and we all laughed and she had no idea why until she stopped to think about it herself. Our family has good times filled with laughter and jokes, but there are also a few very depressing times. About four years ago, an incident happened with my next door neighbor that caused him to be brutally attacked and pass away on our door step. He was very dear to my family and the rest of the cul-de-sac we live in, and for him to die like that was extremely unexpected and terrible to wake up to in the middle of night. After that, there was a period of not very much laughter and fun because we were all haunted by this horror. But, we all knew that his spirit was there to protect us, and so whenever we thought of that, there was a gap between the mourning of his loss, only to be filled in with happiness and laughter. I believe that my family and I have a really tight connection between each other, because we\\'re so funny. There\\'s never any stress between us, but always a calm sense of familiarity and bonding. Someone once said \"\"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.\"\" I believe that, whoever that person is, is right. Even between two strangers that run into each other on the street, if they stop and have a conversation, and one person cracks a joke causing them both to laugh, it\\'s the spark to an immediate connection, and they could become friends for a long time. This is one of the most important values that people have, and most people overlook how much it really matters to humanity.\"'},\n",

All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made.

These library materials are all part of the worlds past and all have a bigger story behind it which has an even bigger story behind it and so on. If we start removing books and everyone removes one then we are going to be left with nothing to learn off of. The world will be less intellegent and we start to forget and lose our past. This is the reason that we must never take any books, movies, music, or magizines off the shelves of a library for it @MONTH1 be special to someone or @MONTH1 be crude to others but it in the end they all contain some past that no other book @MONTH1 contain.      A world with no so called innapropriate books, magazines, music, or movies would be a less crude place but it will be stripping people of knowledge that @MONTH1 be needed. If everyone took a book off the shelve than none would be left. The books would start to lose their love, compasssion, and livlyhood within them. Other books @MONTH1 contain segregation and segregation is a big part of americas past. The word negroe is offensive for some and if we took all of the books with the word negroe out than we would lose @NUM1 years of americas past that cannot be forgotten. Documents containing stories of wars, leaders, rising and fallsing of many empires and kingdoms would all be gone because the violance was to offensive. Many historic moments in the world\\'s history woul.d be lost forever. We cannot get rid of offensive books for the sake of the world\\'s past.     The world would lose too much history in getting rid of offensive books. If the books were put in there own section in the library than kids would not be able to see them causing this to be no  problem for young eyes to see. If you find many books offensive than you just should not go to a library because no matter what happens no books are going to be just thrown away for they have history within them. If we start deshelving books than soon movies will be going and than magazines will be limited to only say so much. I believe that if our kids cannot get to the section with offensive books then we will not  have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials. If we want to keep all the books and people are still trying to throw away offensive books than we should just have a section where offensive books should be and kids cannot get to. In @CAPS1 this is how we could censor books in libraries.      Books, Movies, Magazines, and music are a part of every country in the world today. It is was changes countries and makes them different, it gives them there own culture which we can share with each other. So no matter what we should should never try and take offensive or any kind of book off the shelves of libraries. Censorship @MONTH1 be needed but the offensive materials do not need to be taken off the face of the earth or thrown where no one could ever read it again. All in all we cannot get extinguish the flames of our past or we @MONTH1 never have a future\"'},\n",

On the day of @DATE1 was the day that I will laugh about for the rest of my life. On this day my boyfriend @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 decided that @CAPS1 wanted to take me out to an early breakfast. @CAPS1 called me around four in the morning saying that @CAPS1 was starving and that @CAPS1 needed some food in his stomach. So @CAPS1 picked me up around five am and we went to @ORGANIZATION1. We sat there drank coffee and ate pancakes. We finished very early so @PERSON1 wanted to go for a drive, let me remind @CAPS3 @CAPS1\\'s from @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 has @CAPS6 clue where anything is in @LOCATION2. So as we head out of town I am giving him directions to where the best place is to go for a drive. We are in his @DATE2 poniac which is not the greatest vehicle to be going for a ride in around this town, because around here @CAPS3 need a four wheel drive vehicle otherwise @CAPS3\\'re probably going to get stuck where ever @CAPS3 go. We were doing great at first because we stayed on the pavement roads, but @PERSON1 wanted to explore the gravel roads. So we started to go down a gravel road and we both decided that maybe @CAPS2 was time to go home. When we came up to another road @CAPS1 decided @CAPS1 was going to turn around. That was not the greatest idea. @CAPS1 seen the sign for the street but @CAPS1 turned the wrong way into a field. @CAPS2 was okay, @CAPS8 as first @CAPS2 was . Until @CAPS1 went to back up, and the car wouldn\\'t move. I looked at him and laughed and said \"\"I told @CAPS3 that @CAPS3 needed to go right not left.\"\" @CAPS1 then looked at me and said, \"\"@CAPS2\\'s not stuck I just need to try a little more, and we\\'ll be out.\"\" One thing that @PERSON1 did not know is that @CAPS2 had been warm in @LOCATION2 the last couple of days, so all the fields were very wet and soft. I looked at him and told him that @CAPS1 might not want to @CAPS5 that but @CAPS1 said that is was fine @CAPS1\\'s done this before. So I got out of the car and went and stood by the road. @PERSON1 tried to get the car out of the mud for at least ten minutes, and that was not the greatest thing to @CAPS5, because now the tires were berried under the mud. I started to laugh so hard because @CAPS1 got out of the car and looked at me and said I should have listened. @PERSON1 had one more thing that @CAPS1 wanted to try, because @CAPS6 offense but @CAPS1\\'s a boy and they can @CAPS5 everything themselves. So @CAPS1 told me to get into the car and put @CAPS2 in reverse so I did as @CAPS1 said, then @CAPS1 said okay lightly push on the gas as I push, @CAPS8 I did a little more then lightly push on the gas. I looked up and @PERSON1 was covered in mud from head to toe. @CAPS2 was the greatest thing I have seen in my life, my boyfriend had got what @CAPS1 deserved because @CAPS1 wouldn\\'t listen to me. I looked at him and my eyes instantly started to water, I was trying to hold my laugh in, but @CAPS2 just wasn\\'t working. I started to laugh and @CAPS1 looked at me and said, \"\"@CAPS3 think this is funny?\"\" @CAPS1 then pulled me out of the car and shut the door and started to wipe mud all over my face, I was laughing so hard that i fell and took him down with me right into the mud. @CAPS8 to make the story even better, we went to go open the doors to the car, and @CAPS3 remember how I told @CAPS3 that I put the car in reverse @CAPS8 when @CAPS1 pulled me out i didn\\'t take @CAPS2 out of reverse, and his car locks when its not in park. I then looked at him and said, \"\" @CAPS5 @CAPS3 have an extra key on @CAPS3 by chance?\"\" \"\"@CAPS6\"\", @CAPS1 said, \"\"@CAPS7?\"\" I looked at him and said, \"\"@CAPS8 lets see the car is still running, the windows are up, our phones are still in the car, and @CAPS8 to finish @CAPS2 off the doors are locked.\"\" @CAPS1 looked at me and his mouth dropped. We sat there waiting for almost an hour and a half before anyone came down the road. @CAPS2 took use about forty-three minutes to get the doors unlocked, and then @CAPS2 took us about thirty minutes to get @CAPS2 unstuck.

       "  'content_text': '\"Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 are many books, music, and magazines that are saturated with offensive words or obscene themes.  However, just because a book or song contains an foul word does not mean that the book needs to be sheltered from the public\\'s eyes.  @CAPS2 are many reasons we should not censor public media.  We cannot ignore wrongdoings happening in our world; plus, in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech; and, finally, if media was censored, people @MONTH1 start to think every little word has an offensive connotation.     If a bystander observes a person being abused in a hallway or alley, the bystander just cannot pretend like the incident never happened.  If the world never reported accidents, @CAPS2 would be too much crime and terror.  Sometimes, a book or movie is like a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about some wrongdoing in the world today.  Most of the time, I only hear about an event through movies or books, and I want to know the honest story, not a fairytale version of it.  After all, if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is, some people @MONTH1 not oppose slavery as strongly as they do.    Here in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech.  We are allowed to give our opinions on any topic, and describe it in any way.  We should be permitted to say anything we want, even though in our hearts, we should know what is right and wrong.  People should at least be trusted enough to use their own conscience.     Also, another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people @MONTH1 judge almost every little word offensive then.  Then we @MONTH1 have \\'no books left on the shelf\\' according to Katherine Paterson.  Once people are allowed to censure books or other media, they would look for words with negative connotations.  If a word was close to being offensive in one person\\'s perspective, it would be left out.  Then, many words would be gone.     Sure some types of media, especially songs and movies, just spill out nasty themes and foul language.  However, I have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song.  I can always change the radio station if I do not like what I am hearing.  People however, just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth, no matter how bad it is.  We just cannot pretend that we all live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring.  If we hear about something wrong in our world today, we need to act.  However, we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror.                                                            Sincerely,                                                              @PERSON2\"'},\n",

       "  'content_text': '\" We all understand the benefits of laughter. I believe that laughter is an important part of life that everybody should experience. The time that I remember most where I have laughed and enjoyed myself was when my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION3.It all started with @DATE1. We were opening our presents when my @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 told me and my siblings that they had one last present for us but it was a surprise; in order to know what it was we had to find it. So they told us as a hint, that it was someplace that we sleep. As soon as they told us that I knew exactly where to look, our bedrooms. So we raced up the stairs to our bedrooms and looked around. To our delight, sitting on our nightstands where four packets full of info about @ORGANIZATION1. We were so excited and happy. My little sister said that it was the best @DATE1 present ever. We ran down the stairs, hugged @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, and told them that they are the best @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 ever. What made it even better was that we would miss school. Then we found out that the trip was scheduled for the month of @DATE2. So we had to wait for four months. Those four months were the longest of my life. Four months later it was finally time to go. We had to wake up around @NUM1 a.m because our plane was scheduled to depart at @TIME1. Before we left our house I asked my @CAPS1 if I could bring my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 with me so that I was not bored on the plane. She told me that I could, only if I share it with my little brother. Once we had finally left home I started feeling like I had butterflies in my stomach. I guess it was because something fun and exciting was about to happen to me. When we got to the airport it was @NUM2 so we had about an hour and fifty-five minutes till the plane left. Luckily I had my @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Since my brother was only six years old he easily gets bored, I let him play my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 till we had to board. When it was finally time to board one of my sisters had to use the restroom. My @CAPS1 ended up taking her while my @CAPS2 stayed with us and boarded the plane .My other sister did not like that my @CAPS1 was not on the plane with us yet. So my @CAPS2 told me to keep my brother and sister in their seats while he went o find my @CAPS1 and sister. Five minutes later they all came back, and just in time too. The plane had just finished refueling and we were on the way to the runway. One of my favorite parts of being on a plane is when it\\'s speeding down the runway at amazing speed. And when we finally reached the speed we needed to be at, we launched in to the air and my stomach felt like it was in the open air. My little brother is holding on to my hand so tight that his little knuckles turn white. It gave me the impression that he was scared so I told him to just think about it as a really fast car that goes over a bump. That seemed to help a lot because he started laughing when the plane left the ground. He said that it was fun and wanted to do it again. I reminded him that once we got to @ORGANIZATION1 we would go on all the rides that we want. Three hours later we arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. Once we got off the plane we went to pick up our bags from the baggage claim. My @CAPS2 went to see when the next @CAPS11 @CAPS12 was scheduled to arrive. As he came back the @CAPS12 was just coming down the road. The @CAPS12 was blue with @CAPS11 characters. The driver showed us a lot of cool things and places. The @CAPS15 that we were staying in was called The @CAPS14 @CAPS15. It had a huge pool shaped like a guitar. Once we were settled in we went in to @LOCATION1. It was really fun because my sisters and I got all the @CAPS11 characters autographs and pictures. My favorite one was @CAPS17 because he reminds me of myself. We got to stay in the park for about three hours when we started getting hungry so we left and went back to the @CAPS15. After dinner we went down to the pool to go swimming. It seemed to be funner than @ORGANIZATION1 because in the week we were there we spent more time laughing and swimming down by the pool than actually in @LOCATION1. That is the best time that I had ever had in my life and I owe it all to my parents. I love them very much. Thank you.\"'},\n",

You look shelf after shelf, not locating @CAPS1 anywhere. You searched everywhere, by everything that the book would possibly be listed under. You\\'ve browsed paper backs, hard backs; eventually letting your frustration take over.Giving up on locating the novel, you walk over to the librarian and ask about @CAPS1. She replies with, \\'I\\'m sorry, we had to remove that particular novel due to a person finding @CAPS1 offensive to them.\\' You\\'re infuriated, you decide to write a article to your local newspaper about the outrage of the books, movies, music, etc. that has been taken out of your local library.     Personally, I don\\'t think that the media taken away from the library should be considered offensive. How can you consider what is offensive and what is not? A book could be offensive to one person, but not another. Different people have different opinions, and @CAPS1\\'s not reasonable to remove a book or other type of media from a library because @CAPS1 contains \\'offensive material.\\' @CAPS1\\'s ridiculous; @CAPS1 infuriates me that someone would do that. If you think @CAPS1 could get into the hands of a child, or someone that @CAPS1 would effect, do not rent the item. That\\'s why at most libraries, there are seperate areas for adults and children so that children don\\'t obtain these items.     How can you determine if something is offensive? I personally don\\'t find a lot of things offensive, but just because something is offensive to me, doesn\\'t mean I will request to have @CAPS1 banned so that other people can\\'t enjoy @CAPS1. If you find something offensive, just leave @CAPS1 alone. Don\\'t bother, annoy, or hassle someone else that had nothing to do with its creation with @CAPS1. @CAPS1\\'s not only disrepectful to the individual you file a complaint to, but the artist who created @CAPS1. You do have the right to voice your opinion, but sometimes, @CAPS1 doesn\\'t have to voiced.     We live in such a closed-minded world. We have people who don\\'t even think @CAPS1\\'s approprite to show one\\'s arm. I can see why some people take offense to these things, but honestly, @CAPS1\\'s mediocre to report something just becuase you do not agree with @CAPS1. We have a vast knowledge of what\\'s right or wrong, what is or is not appropriate for an audience to hear. If @CAPS1 weren\\'t appropriate, you honestly think @CAPS1 would have been published? Sure there are things in book, music, etc. that are inappropriate, but to be so closed-minded to have something banned for use of foul language, minor sexual content, or violence is unlogical. You can find worse, hear worse, just by walking down the street just about anywhere.     To answer the question bluntly, no, I do not think that media should be banned just because @CAPS1 is offensive. We as @CAPS2 have the right to speak our voice, from two different perspectives. You can argue if something is mediocre, is offensive; I will argue back, just because I have the right to voice my opinion as you do. These reasons that enjoyable media are banned, such as language and violence, add emphasis, meaning, emotion, and make the reader dig for so much more in a book, song, etc. These are how the authors see their work, they want to show the people what they see, even if @CAPS1 does offend someone else.\"'},\n",

If a cd contains adult content and the child is underage and grabs it off the shelf listening to it, then its the parents fault for not being responsible enough to watch their child. Same goes for books and etc.. Now if the child is old enough to understand what they grab then they should be able to listen to it, and ask questions about it. If its about adult relationships and the child takes it, then the parent should explain it all and tell them what is going on. The parent should be the one to take responsibility.                           Now, if a book, music, movie, magazine, and ect.contain raceism in it then it should be censored, unless its about history. Kids under the age of teen usally repeat what they hear or read. Same goes for teenagers too actualy! Books with the wrong kind of words in it should be kept safe or there should be a age to where you can get it. The world has enough horrid language in it, why should the library add to it by letting kids get ahold of these books and repeating what they hear.                  I remember when I was walking around a library and I saw a little kid not older than @NUM1 grab an adult book and started to open it and look through it. The parent was no where to be seen nor heard, who leaves their child in a book section like that? This young boy put the book down on the hard floor and started to take off his clothes.

There are also certain people who need book for research and need to take home books for their projects. We should\\'nt have censorship and take down all the books that should be contained from kids. Some of us need those kind of books in order for us to do our research and projects!      No we should\\'nt have censorship in our libraries! Im not about to be able to miss a project or miss a good movie because some parents don\\'t know how to control their kids and watch what they grab. We should be able to keep all the books, movies, magazines, and ect., there could be a way to censor most books but they would need their own shelf, and they could be a age lemit or a pass people could use. That would take to long to do so though. So keep our libraries filled with interesting things without censoring them!\"'},\n",

Builders then had to brainstorm how passengers would board, along with a place for baggage and ticketing. To resolve this, a glassed-in observation area and open observation platform were constructed. Another obstacle was the existing airship law for how low they could fly.

We\\'ve stayed close throughout the years because we\\'ve always done similar activities. We\\'re very different from each other though. I\\'m more out going, I like to speak my mind and I\\'m more carefree. @CAPS4\\'s the opposite. @CAPS4\\'s very conservative and @CAPS4 can take things too seriously. But either way, we manage to even each other out. Finals week had just gotten over, and @LOCATION1 and I had been planning a sleepover all week. We just needed time to relax and have some time to ourselves. When I had gotten home from school, I gave her a quick call. \"\"@CAPS3?\"\" @CAPS4 answered. \"\"@CAPS5, @CAPS12 time did @CAPS16 wanna hang out?\"\" I asked. \"\"I was thinking @NUM2?\"\" \"\"@CAPS6 good!\"\" I quickly hung up the phone and gathered up my gear. I grabbed my toothbrush, pillow, pajamas, and my blanket. I put my shoes on and headed back out the door. My dad dropped me off with all of me gear. I had brought my pajamas, my pillow, and an extra blanket. I walked up her sidewalk to her door, knocked, and waited. Only seconds later did @CAPS4 answer it with a big smile across her face. @CAPS4 lead me down to her basement where @CAPS4 had all the junk food set out ready for us to attack. @CAPS4 had gone to the store earlier that day and had bought everything. @CAPS4 had set it all up on her old pool table that nobody used. There were chips, cookies, sodas, candy, chocolate, and pizza. I set my stuff down on the chair in the corner of the room and we feasted. Of course, we could eat all the food. We simply weren\\'t big enough. After eating for almost an hour straight, we laid on her basement floor trying to gain composure. We started laughing at silly little things that came up on commercials on her big screen @CAPS7. Eventually, we got to talking about how each of our finals went. \"\"I did soo good on all of mine! I\\'m gonna get ALL A\\'s\"\" @PERSON1 bragged. @CAPS4 has gotten straight A\\'s every year since middle school. \"\"I think I did pretty @CAPS8 too, not so sure about a @NUM3 though.\"\" I said as I was laying upside down on the floor. \"\"@CAPS8, we\\'ll just see tomorrow!\"\"  We finally decided to move ourselves over to the couch on the opposite side of the pool table, so we could face the @CAPS7. It was already @NUM4 in the @TIME1 and we were still on a sugar high. We switched back and forth from watching some old scary movie, and the top @NUM5 music videos of the week. That had passed some time and before we knew it, it was @NUM2 in the @TIME1. @PERSON1 and I were laying on opposite ends of each other. Occasionally, one of us would get some chips or candy from the table. We grew tired to the point where we couldn\\'t keep our eyes open. No one even had enough energy to turn off the overhead light. We fell asleep fast. When I woke-up the next @TIME1, @PERSON1 wasn\\'t laying across from me anymore. @CAPS4 was sitting in the corner chair where I had set my stuff. I looked at the clock, and it was already @NUM4:30 in the afternoon. I looked back and @LOCATION1, @CAPS4 seemed somewhat upset. I shifted around under my blanket so I could face her. \"\"@CAPS5...\"\" I grunted, while I was stretching. \"\"@TIME1.\"\" @CAPS4 said abruptly. @CAPS4 was holding a folded piece of paper in her hand. \"\"@CAPS12\\'s up?\"\" I asked, sitting up on the couch. @CAPS4 crumpled up the piece of paper and threw it at me. I picked it up from my lap and unfolded it. It was her report card. I scanned down the paper looking at all of her grades. @CAPS4 had received all A\\'s... and one @CAPS13. @CAPS4 had gotten a @CAPS13 in her @CAPS15 class. I looked up from the paper to see her hands covering her face. I walked over to her kinda amused by how upset @CAPS4 was.  \"\"@CAPS16 got a @CAPS13... and @CAPS16\\'re crying?\"\" I asked. @CAPS4 looked up at me quickly. I looked at her with a stupid face, and @CAPS4 busted out laughing. @CAPS4 felt so stupid for crying over @NUM8 @CAPS13. I stared laughing too. I knew my grades we be far worse. Heck, I\\'d be glad to get @CAPS13\\'s. @PERSON1 and I are the perfect best friends. We even each other out. I tell her to lighten up, and @CAPS4 tells me to focus more. @CAPS16 can\\'t take little things like that too seriously, it\\'s just not worth the stress. Sometimes @CAPS16 just gotta relax, and maintain your focus. @CAPS16 have to find your perfect balance of work, and play.\"'},\n",

I have had a select few instances throughout my life where I have read a book or magazine that to some @MONTH1 seem offensive and to others not at all.  However, I do have my own view point on the situation and I feel that @CAPS2 is my duty to inform you that I feel offensive books, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves.     Everyone has grown up and been taught different values and morals that are important to them. They stand for these values, but at the same time respect that other people have the right to believe differently than they do.  With the world the way @CAPS2 is now, violence can errupt from the simplest of things.  Putting books on public shelves for the public to read, can very easily cause outbursts and debates between people who have opposite opinions.  Offensive books and magazines put out for the public is asking for something bad to be a result.     My suggestion to you is to remove these offensive books.  This will create a safe and happy envioronment for all who visit public libraries,and other public places.  @CAPS2 will create fewer arguments between adults and set an example for younger children who are observing their parents behaviors.  Children follow in their parents\\' footsteps.  Observing bad behaviors from the parents due to offensive books does not teach the child how to act in a responsible way if they were put in this postion.  When our children grow up, we want them to beahve in a responsible way.  Offensive books not being put on shelves will hopefully create a healthful environment for appropriate behavior.     As a student, I want to grow up in a world that has people who are resepectful, happy, and responsible. I want people to get along with each other.  I feel that taking offensive books off shelves will help with this somewhat peaceful world I would like to live in.  Violence can be created through anything, and I feel that offensive books should be the last thing added to that.  Without offensive books for the public to read, will create a better environment for the people living today.\"'},\n",

Libraries hold almost every book ever writen and offer them to the public free of charge.  If you can not find what you are looking for in a book, they also have many other resources: movies, music, magazines, and the internet.  I am not here to say that we should band any materials that are offensives because everything is offensive to somebody.     There is always somebody out in the world that would say they are offened just to make a point or to get attention in our world today even if they did not even care about the subject at hand.  The internet can take you to just about any thing that you would ever want to go to.  Yes, the libraries do have blocks on the internet for websites that are very outragously offensive, but people have learned how to get around the blocks.     Libraries are set up to where all the kids materials is in one location, all the teenage stuff is in another spot, and all the adult materials are in another room.  As a young child, I liked going to  libraries and having fun and reading, but the one thing I never did was go to the adult room and I think many other other kids feel the same way.  In fact, I have never seen a child in the adult section of a library.     Movies and music have ratings and if the rating is over what the child should be watching, then the child can not check the movie or music without a parent\\'s signiture.  This ensures that kids can not check out bad or offensive materials without parental consent.     Our libraries are set up just fine the way they are and I feel we should not try to change the libraries in any way.  Movies and music have rating and kids can not check out offensive materials.  The materials in a library are organized by age group and kids usually do not venture out of the area of their interest.  Last but not least, if we took out everything in libraries that are offensive, then we would know longer have libraries in our communities.\"'},\n",

It has come to my notice that this @CAPS5 exactly what our library has just thought about doing to any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that any person finds offensive.  To this I disagree.  The world @CAPS5 a better place to live, when everyone has a level playing field.  Some information @CAPS5 sensitive, but that same information should never be blocked completely for nothing more than just the @CAPS6 itself. Our country @CAPS5 based on a freedom of press and speech, to deny that @CAPS5 to deny our livelihood as a country.  To solve a situation as this, we must all create a type of checks and balances system to keep the information out there, but also protecting it from younger ones until the time @CAPS5 right from a guardian\\'s viewpoint.         Our country has many problems, but a few of them are @CAPS3 the core values that are upheld in the @CAPS6.  In the @CAPS6 it @CAPS5 stated that we have the freedom of press and speech.  This means that we can publish anything, no matter the inappropriateness of the matter.  This also protects any reader from being denied the right to have information at their fingertips.  There was just an example of this, inside the @LOCATION1,when a local library had to allow any person wanting to look up porn on library computers because of the laws stated in the @CAPS6.  However much some @MONTH1 dislike the thought of this much freedom, we cannot ban works purely based on the discretion of some.     The world @CAPS5 a contantly changing place, with almost nothing a given constant.  This @CAPS5 the exact same for information of all types.  No one can say what will or won\\'t be accepted in our society in the future.  At this moment many sexual subjects are quite offensive to many and are viewed unacceptable to the younger generation.  The only problem with this @CAPS5 the ease at which this type of information can be gotten.  The internet @CAPS5 the very place where so much information passes through, be it good or bad.  To block all of this information just can\\'t be done, but to restrict it @CAPS5 our only hope.     To to create such a restriction, our library can needs to have a type of checks and balances sytem that could allow those with orderly consent or those of age to get a hold of these types of works. Those of age @NUM1 or older could easily be allowed into sections containing these works, but those under @NUM1 would have to have a guardian\\'s consent before allowed in these sections.  A perfect example of this would be off of \\'@CAPS10 @CAPS11 and The @CAPS12 of @CAPS13\\' when @CAPS10 @CAPS5 @CAPS3 allowed in the restricted section of the library unless he has a signed pass from a teacher.  That type of protection would still allow the works to be released to the public, but still keeping the younger generation from having any freedom to look at inappropriate items for their age.     As humans we crave information, whether it be via watching, listening, or reading.  To block any part of this experience @CAPS5 to block our full potential.  Many things are offensive, but then again much of life @CAPS5 offensive.  Our founding fathers knew this and took it with them while writing the @CAPS6, and now we have a @CAPS6 that protects all our information.  This @CAPS5 a very good thing, but some things need to be upheld from those too young to understand the meaning of them.  We need to protect our freedoms, but also protect our children.  To do this we must create a program that allows those that want view what they want, and those that are too young view what they are allowed by their guardians.\"'},\n",

In paragraph @NUM1 it says, \"\"Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.\"\" This displays the fire, and therefore safety, was an obstacle. Next, air currents made it difficult for dirigibles to dock safely. The air near the top of the building was affected by air currents, so it was difficult for pilots to land. Also, \"\"using [lead weights] at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe.\"\" There was no way to work with or combat the uncertainty of the wind, so nature was an obstacle. Finally, there were laws about aircrafts flying too close to the city. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, \"\"[There] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.\"\" The very purpose of the moor would be illegal, so it would be nearly impossible for a dirigible to ever tie up to the Empire State Building.

The way the men directed him seem all going for his water supply is all in store, and the first land mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be. The next �town� he hits doesn�t have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply and he starts to feel troubled. However he was told the next town wasn�t further, so he pressed on. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming hills, the sun beating hotter- it really look like a desert after tumbleweeds even go past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated. The next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water. He keeps on, however, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The canging scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, relief.\"'},\n",

If people who find the materials in libraries offensive are getting upset over the lack of censorship within the library itsself, they should re-think the situation and consider that the \\'offensive\\' materials that are left within libraries could be considered appropriate IF the viewer is ready to experience them. If a person does not want to be exposed to things in libraries that could be considered offensive, then they can altogether avoid these materials. If parents find the materials that are within libraries offensive, they should monitor their children while they are visiting their library. The mateirals that could be considered offensive @MONTH1 actually be good, educational media that a person could learn from. If @CAPS1 within libraries increases, \\'then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.\\' @CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as it is now.      Some books, movies, and any other number of things that can be found within libraries are bieng labeled as innapropriate. These materials can be educational, however, and should not be removed from libraries altogether just because some of the materials are found to be too crude, vulgar, or adult-like for younger ages. Parents should monitor their children while in a library as to not let them stumble upon something that they would not want them to see yet. If something is labeled as innappropriate for children to view by parents, then it is the parents responsibility to make sure thier child does not stumble upon it.      Much of what @MONTH1 be considered as innapropriate and needing cencoroship in libraries to this day @MONTH1 actually hold some educational value or meaning to it. There are books and movies that are based off of true stories that have taken place that could be announced by parents as \\'not appropriate to be viewed by children\\'. However, this does not mean that libraries should have to remove the material from their shelves just because parents @MONTH1 not think or necessarily agree that it would be appropriate for their child to read or see. It is the parents resposibility to see that their child does not check out what they would consider innappropriate. Much of the things within libraries that might be considered innappropriate for children hold good eduactional value and should not have to be removed from the shelves of the library simply because parents find it not age appropriate for their children.      @CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as it is now so that those who want to see or read the stories or movies can do so without having to buy them. If parents want to make a big deal out of how libraries hold materials that are not appropriate for their children, they can either altogether not go to a library or they can monitor their children closely if they bring them along on a library visit. I have found that when I visit my library, I look at it as a source of knowledge that has been pooled in one place, written and created by thousands of authors, all of which took time out of their own lives to create it. If we are going to remove these books or movies from libraries, I think it would be taking away the rights that people have to the materials that SHOULD be provided by a library. @CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as it is today so that people can enjoy all that should be within it, even if some of it is labeled as innappropriate by parents\"'},\n",

The other obstacle was that blimps couldn\\'t get close enough to the mast, due to the wind, like the Los angeles. Due to all of these obstacles, the mooring mast hasn\\'t been used since.\"'},\n",

Pulling a book, cd, dvd/vcr tape, magazine, etc.,because of whether or not they are offensive or obscene is a panzy move from the people who think the world must be perfect when in reality it is so far from perfect that it is disgusting,and yet the sad truth is the fact that only a small percentage of people on the face of the earth have come to accept this truth. If I have not conviced you other wise please keep reading.     I believe that if the world can not handle what is on the shelf at the public library they should just leave it alone, and stay in there comfort zone of reading seletions. If they are offended they can go to read some where else.       I understand that people might have been there first. If that is the case well then nicely ask the person/persons offending you to move some where else.     The world is not a perfect place by no means. The world does have it\\'s positives for instance the @CAPS1 nations, and north atlantic treaty organization (@CAPS2.A.T.O.), but for some reason the world acts as if they are going to die if there is not perfection all around them.

If you do think it\\'s offensive, then don\\'t read it or just pick out another book. Everybody has their own ideas on a library and if they want their voices heard let them speak it out.      What I think about all this stuff in the library these days are good for the kids so they can learn faster and have a lot more to look forward to when they do get older. My own experiences in the library that I do see that there is a lot more people in the library and there is a lot more you can do instead of reading books most of the time. You can read magazines or newspapers to pass the time when no one is home or to hang out with, and it does get boring just reading books so try something different for a little while then go back reading the book that you did start with and wanted to take a break from.      Then other people have their own voice to say something if they don\\'t want it in their library. Some of my observations that I have seen were not really good. I\\'ve seen some protesters in front of the libraries and I have seen them close down because of it. But people sometime can take it to far and do sometimes burn it to the ground. I have seen people cry over it and it makes me really upset that I want to do something to help them but I really can\\'t do nothing.      The most valueable thing is the kids and young children that read the books. What if someone burn down you home, this is how these kids feel when you close down the most safe place to them? They have the biggest voice of everybody put together. That if you do something that make them feel better that would be really good to them. That they have not done anything to deserve this kind of mess that we put them through. It is very difficult to have somewhere to go to read but there is nowhere to go.      If you don\\'t want to be quiet then let your voice be heard aroud the world and have the freedom to let it come out. You have three diffenent voices your own, other people that do or don\\'t agree and you have your children. So which one are you going to listen to?

We ordered a @CAPS1 and some drinks. @PERSON1 decided to shake up my soda @CAPS13 hand it to me.

I chased her for about a block and a half. Basically to my yard before I slid on mud, and @CAPS13 fell in a puddle of water. I thought I was going to loose it when @PERSON1 was laughing too dramaticly. Out of @CAPS14 were, I jumped up and was going to put her face in it. @CAPS3 ended up running inside my house, and locking the door. The reason I knew @CAPS3 @CAPS2 lock it, was because I ran @CAPS6 fast to bust in. before I @CAPS2 I turned the knob, but it didn\\'t open though. Instead the impact forced me to fly back, and land on poop. The bad part was that it was fresh, why, well because my back was warm in a certain spot. I quickly took off my shirt and threw it away, @CAPS13 headed inside to shower. @PERSON1 asked me why I was going to shower, but I decided to lie to her. @CAPS12 I told her what really happen, @CAPS13 @CAPS3 will laugh and make fun of me. After I was done showering I asked @PERSON1, \"\"@CAPS7 you want to go shoot some glass bottles in the back?\"\" @CAPS3 replied, \"\"@CAPS9 I\\'m down let\\'s go!\"\" @CAPS6 I set up six bottles and was ready to shoot.

The only thing I @CAPS2 was swore like @CAPS14 other, and aimed my gun to @PERSON1 to get her back. @CAPS3 was quick to run upstairs and grab my @NUM1. @CAPS3 said with a freaked out voice, \"\"@CAPS12 you come any closer I\\'ll throw this out the window!\"\" @CAPS13 I said to her, \"\"@CAPS14 you won\\'t, you know how much I paid for that!\"\" @CAPS15 my luck shot her in the leg.

If they are left on the shelves some very small child or teens could come up and reach for a book and find that it has bad things in it that are ment for adults. The child will ask the caregiver that they are with \\'@CAPS1 does this picture mean?\\', and they will most likely not know @CAPS1 to say at that moment. Parents and caregivers are not always up to explaining or want to explain as soon as they have to about things sometimes. Everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates. Somethings should be taught when we young like how to brush our teeth, but somethings should be left until we are older like having babies or drinking.           When parents going through the explaination of something like making babies you do not want it to be when they are only five years old. With books in a library with pictures of men and women questions like that do get asked to young. Libraries are public places and should be safe for any age no matter whether they are young babies or adults. Public schools have libraries in them also, and i would not want a child reading a @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 book with bad or offensive things in it. It does not just have to be a book with bad things in it, but it could also be something to do with religions. Everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion. If you have grown up a @CAPS4 your whole life, and a kid picks up a book dealing with jews they will ask someone about it.      Young kids and teens can always find things that they should notat certain ages, but why not make it less by not letting a library be censorshiped? When you were younger your parent did not want to take you to the library and be asked an offensive question because of a book, music, movie, or magazine.

Another obstacle that arose was the fact that the violent wind at such an altitude would toss the back of the ship back and forth. This would not only be a technical hassle as it would also make it nearly impossible to get passengers in and out of the dirigible, and make it a frightening experience for anyone inside the ship as well. In addition, the ships could not be weighed down with lead weights as it would be too risky to have them dangling high above pedestrians. A final implication was that if dirigibles moored at the Empire State building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

       "  'content_text': '\"Cursing, violence, gang activity, murder, ect. All of these  are factors found in our books and music we have today. Do you believe these items should be cencered? If books or music have these types of messages in them it is going to influence children and adult\\'s choices on what they do in life. I feel that, yes books and music should be cencored.          My first supporting reason of why books and music should be cencored is the fact that children and adults get a huge influence from the information. Look in today\\'s world; murders are happening, gang violence, and even abuse. If a book or song is advertising about murdering some one, or selling drugs nine times out of ten people think that is the \\'cool\\' thing to do so why not do it. With people following uncencored books and songs it leaves dead people, inmates, and poor choices. Most people want to follow what an artist or author is doing because they are famous, which is causing peer preasure.     The second reason books and music should be censored is the simple fact of respect. Some books or music affends people by their race, religion, or their apperance. You find most of the critizisium from music more than books, but it does occur. Young children and teens shouldn\\'t listen to or read about racism, sex, how to drugs, ect. Books and music that have advertisment about these types of things is disrespectful to parents and what they teach their children. The message brought from the book or song is basically saying go against your parents and do this. A person should be able to sit and listen to a nice song, or book without getting disrespected and offended.     My final reasoning for books and music being cencored is the reputation it will have or has. Books and music are just like people, they can send off the wrong message leaving a bad reputation upon others. For instance, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 tend to have a lot of bad messaged songs, so therefore most people think that all @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are bad. If songs and books were cencored there wouldn\\'t be a sterio type against a certain type of music, or books have the best message. A normal person bases the first song, or book they hear/read by if or not they or their child can listen to or read that type of material.      Love, positive messages, influencing good, these are the types of things most people want to hear or read. If books and music are cencored there will not be any more cursing on the radio, bad ideas given to those influenced, and could stop less violence. Again I state, yes I feel books and music should be cencored.\"'},\n",
